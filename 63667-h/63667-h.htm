A BOY'S ADVENTURES ROUND THE WORLD
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER I
<br /><br />
HIS FIRST CHOICE
</h3>

<p>
Jack Clewlin was born at Trafalgar Place,
a substantial residence commanding an
excellent view of the seaport town of Stonewell,
and its spacious, island-studded harbour.
</p>

<p>
During his earlier years the boy saw little of
his father, who was almost constantly at sea in
charge of a ship, and to his mother he owed that
sound Christian training, and those God-fearing
principles, which subsequently became so deeply
impressed on his mind and character.
</p>

<p>
'You will not always have me with you, Jack,'
she would frequently say.  'Therefore, my dear
son, I want to give you the best advice that boy or
man can receive.  Fear God.  Lead a simple and
a pure life.  Be strong to resist those worldly
temptations which beset all those who strive to
follow in the footsteps of the blessed Saviour.  To
command others you must first command <i>yourself</i>.
By prayer alone can such a victory be obtained,
yet rest assured that His ear is ever open to the cry
of those needing guidance and support.'  In close
companionship mother and son continued to live
happily at Stonewell.
</p>

<p>
When Jack had reached his eighth year
Captain Clewlin retired from active life, and
settled down quietly at Trafalgar Place.  Some
two years later the boy lost his mother, but on his
mind her winsome features were indelibly impressed,
and in his heart the seeds of her wisdom and
excellent teaching had taken deep root.
</p>

<p>
At sixteen years of age Jack had developed into
a strong and well set-up youngster, keenly alive to
the enjoyments of outdoor existence.
</p>

<p>
About that time he was offered a junior clerkship
under the Stonewell Harbour Board, but he felt no
inclination for such a life.
</p>

<p>
'I should like to be a sailor, dad,' he said.
Captain Clewlin uttered a short, satisfied laugh.
</p>

<p>
'It's bred in the bone,' he exclaimed.  'Well,
I would not put you to anything unsuitable, my
son.  At the same time you must clearly understand
that the life at first will be rough and
arduous.  I will give you a month to consider the
matter.'
</p>

<p>
'Thank you, dad,' Jack replied; 'I'm not afraid of
roughing it.  There is no other calling I should like
half so well.'
</p>

<p>
The captain expressed much satisfaction at the
choice which his son had made, and, as the latter
remained of the same opinion, the preliminary steps
toward his sea apprenticeship were taken.
</p>

<p>
A few weeks later, on a certain beautiful morning
in the month of February, a fine clipper ship, in tow
of a tug, entered the harbour, and dropped her anchor
nearly opposite the town.
</p>

<p>
She was named the 'Silver Crown,' was 'flying
light' in ballast trim, two streaks of her muntz-metal
sheathing being above the water line.  She had come
round from Liverpool to embark several hundreds
of emigrants awaiting conveyance to Queensland,
Australia.
</p>

<p>
She was of nearly eighteen hundred tons measurement,
and presented a sufficiently striking appearance,
since like a castle she towered above all other ships
in port.
</p>

<p>
The fore, the main, and the mizen masts were lofty
and squarely rigged, each of them carried double
topsail yards, with single topgallant and royal yards
above them.
</p>

<p>
The 'house' flag of the firm to which she belonged
fluttered from the main royal masthead, British
colours floated from the spanker gaff-end, and much
brasswork shone about the stern.
</p>

</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p>
In short, the 'Silver Crown' was one of the fastest
and most famous sailing clipper ships afloat.
</p>

<p>
This was the vessel in which Jack Clewlin was
about to begin a long and honourable career on
the sea, to experience some dangers, adventures, and
privations, and no boy ever felt prouder as he listened
to the many expressions of admiration passed on
her by competent experts ashore.
</p>

<p>
Her commander, Captain Robert Thorne, was a
finely proportioned, pleasant-looking man of middle
age, heavily bearded, and of thorough sailor-like
appearance, always anxious for the comfort and the
safety of those placed in his charge, and prompt and
decisive in action.
</p>

<p>
His first and second officers were also highly
experienced and capable men.  William Sennit, the
first mate, was a tall and powerful-looking man of
thirty years, sun-tanned and weather-beaten features
denoting constant exposure to the heat and the
storms of every portion of the world; while a slight
nasal accent, with dark brown hair that fell almost
to his shoulders, indicated an American nationality.
His clear, ringing voice was always distinct in the
midst of any gale.
</p>

<p>
Stephen Statten, the second mate, was a native
of Devonshire, and of medium height, but the
breadth of shoulders was particularly striking, and
his muscular limbs denoted great strength.
</p>

<p>
He was about twenty-five years of age, keen-eyed,
alert, and of a kindly disposition, and with Jack
Clewlin he became as friendly as discipline permitted.
</p>

<p>
In addition to these the 'Silver Crown' carried a
surgeon, a purser and his assistant, one carpenter, a
sailmaker, a boatswain and his two mates, four
quarter-masters for steering, with several cooks and
stewards, while thirty able-bodied and ordinary
seamen occupied a comfortable topgallant forecastle.
</p>

<p>
The saloon was already filled with first cabin
passengers, and the forward deck-house, or second
cabin, was also occupied by ladies and gentlemen,
but one room there had been allotted to the use of
four apprentices, all of whom were 'first voyagers.'
</p>

<p>
Accompanied by his father, Jack presently joined
his ship, and they were received by the chief mate at
the gangway.
</p>

<p>
'This lad is my son, sir,' Captain Clewlin explained.
'He is bent on making a voyage with you, and in
due course may, perhaps, become a good sailor.'
</p>

<p>
'I hope so, sir,' the officer replied.  'If he obeys
orders we shall get on together all right.'
</p>

<p>
'There is little fear of his not doing so,' the captain
said.  'He's had a good education, and careful home
training by one of the best and truest women that
ever breathed.'
</p>

<p>
By that time Jack's clothes chest and bed gear
had been placed in the deck-house, and as father
and son stood together in the room the former
earnestly addressed the boy&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'Jack,' he said, and pressed the lad's hand, 'you
are now on the eve of your real life.  I took to it
before your age, and know what difficulties and
temptations surround the life of those who "go
down to the sea in ships."  Three truths I would
earnestly impress on your mind.  Never forget to
read your Bible, no matter what sneers, or even rough
usage, may be brought to bear by those who do not
love God, and would endeavour to lead you from that
straight and narrow course which your dear mother
trod, but from which it is so easy to stray.  You
promise, Jack?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, dad,' Jack replied; 'I shall always do so, no
matter what may happen.'
</p>

<p>
'Good boy!' the captain exclaimed.  'Remember
God has said that "them that honour Me I will
honour," and that assurance is as true as every other
contained in the Bible.  And there are two things I
want you to avoid.  Shun all intoxicating liquors,
and do not smoke before you have reached the years
of manhood.  I am most anxious that you should
remember these matters.  I hope you will return
home as pure and good a lad as I leave you now;
but, in case I should not live to see you again, I shall
die believing that you have kept your word.'
</p>

<p>
Tears filled the boy's eyes, and flinging his arms
about the neck of his father, he kissed him, and again
vowed to stand by the promises he had made.
</p>

<p>
With a close embrace father and son parted.
</p>

<p>
That afternoon the windlass was manned, and across
the harbour floated the sea chanty:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Sing ho, for a gay and gallant bark,<br />
  A brisk and a lively breeze,<br />
  A bully crew, and skipper, too,<br />
  To carry us over the seas.<br />
  To carry us over the seas, brave boys,<br />
  Where dancing dolphins play,<br />
  And whales and sharks are up to larks,<br />
  Ten thousand miles away.'<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
With a merry rattle of the pawls the heavy chain
cable came in over the barrel of the windlass, and
with his young shipmates Jack Clewlin hauled at
the tackle which kept the iron links taut, and
prevented them from slipping forward through the
'hawse-pipe.'
</p>

<p>
'Anchor's away, sir!' the mate sang out.
</p>

<p>
With fastened hawser the attending tug swung the
ship toward the harbour entrance.
</p>

<p>
Several local steamers, filled with the friends of
the emigrants, accompanied the vessel for some
distance, and amidst much cheering, and the waving
of handkerchiefs, the 'Silver Crown' passed out
between the forts protecting the harbour.
</p>

<p>
'Hands aloft and loose canvas,' the captain sang
out.  Men ran up the rigging like monkeys.  The
lower topsails were sheeted home, the others were
speedily mastheaded, and with all plain sail set the
beautiful clipper began her long voyage of 20,000
miles across the ocean.
</p>

<p>
The tug-boat and the accompanying vessels
returned to port.  The last notes of 'Auld Lang
Syne' were lost on the breeze, while careening
gracefully the splendid vessel speedily sank all trace
of the land under the horizon astern.
</p>

<p>
The afternoon was beautifully fine, and the sea
almost smooth.  The slight movements of the ship,
however; presently sent most of the passengers
below; but, thanks to his many boating expeditions
about Stonewell harbour, Jack felt no inconvenience,
and kept to the deck and his duties as closely as
his more seasoned messmates, who, on their
passage from Liverpool, had got rid of their
sea-sickness.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, so many things required looking after
and securing in their places, that none of the hands
had one moment's leisure, and all the boys found
plenty of work to occupy their attention.  Mr. Sennit,
the chief mate, had most of the men engaged
on the topgallant forecastle securing the anchors,
and lashing the cables on deck until the ship had
reached blue water.
</p>

<p>
Shortly before supper all hands mustered about
the main capstan, and from them each officer
alternately selected a man until the whole had been
equally divided into the port and the starboard
watches.
</p>

<p>
Jack was, of course, also chosen, and found
himself under the orders of Mr. Statten, the second
mate, with Charley Wilton, a lad of his own age,
as companion.
</p>

<p>
Of the other two boys who belonged to the port
or chief mate's watch, he saw but little, since while
he kept the deck they were 'below,' but the elder
of them, George Archer, was a bright, cheery-mannered
lad of sixteen, while his companion,
Edward Sorter, was rough-looking, ill-tempered,
and worse-mannered, and he was mostly left to his
own reflections.
</p>

<p>
With that youth Jack experienced his first difficulty
in keeping faith with his father.
</p>

<p>
As night closed in Jack prepared to 'turn out
for duty at eight bells.'  Shortly before that time
he determined to read a few words from the Bible,
and on his knees ask the protection of God during
the hours of darkness.
</p>

<p>
While he read, Sorter entered the room.  'Hullo!'
he cried, 'what sort of yarn are you reading?'
</p>

<p>
'It is the Bible,' Jack replied.
</p>

<p>
'The <i>what!</i> you Psalm-singing booby, we don't
want that kind of thing here!  Put it away at once!'
</p>

<p>
Jack went on reading until the book was suddenly
snatched from his hand, and thrown to the end
of the room.
</p>

<p>
In an instant the insulted lad was on his feet,
his eyes flashing, and his fists clenched ready to
strike out in defence of the volume which his
beloved and dead mother had so treasured.
</p>

<p>
'See here, Sorter,' he said, 'I don't want to fight
with you.  I mean to read my Bible in spite of
whatever you may think or do; but if ever you
attempt to check me again I think I know how to
defend myself.'
</p>

<p>
As Jack attempted to recover his property, the
bully, evidently bent on injuring the book, dashed
toward it, and at the same time dealt his opponent
a sharp blow.
</p>

<p>
To his astonishment, however, he received another
of such weight as knocked him into a lower bunk.
Then, seizing his treasure, Jack rapidly locked it
within his clothes chest, and stood on the defensive.
But although eyeing him threateningly, Sorter did
not resume the contest, and presently he sneaked
away.
</p>

<p>
'God gave me the strength to do that,' Jack
mused; 'and while I live I'll fight His enemies.'
</p>

<p>
At eight bells, eight o'clock, he and Wilton went
aft to 'keep the bells going,' since time at sea is
reckoned in that manner.  A brisk breeze off the
starboard beam sent the clipper along in good
style, while for several miles on every hand a vast
expanse of night-darkened sea stretched to the
horizon where sky and water seemed to meet.
</p>

<p>
The silence was intense, and to the boy it seemed
as though God was indeed very close to him,
and that He was listening to the prayers of those
who had intrusted their lives to His fatherly care.
</p>

<p>
Beside the wheel the helmsman stood erect,
the lookout forward paced to and fro, most of the
emigrants seemed to be abed, and Mr. Statten, the
second mate, peered through his glasses at some
imaginary object far aweather.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap02"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER II
<br /><br />
DRAWING SOUTHWARD
</h3>

<p>
At four bells, ten o'clock, the wheel and the
lookout were relieved, the red and green
sidelights were trimmed, and Jack took over the
remaining half of time-keeping.
</p>

<p>
The heaving of the log showed a speed of eight
knots an hour, and as the wind was only moderate
such progress proved highly satisfactory.
</p>

<p>
Save one small lamp all lights in the saloon were
extinguished, and only a few remained alight down
below.
</p>

<p>
Captain Thorne came on deck for a few minutes
before turning in, and all hands, save those on watch,
were soon asleep.
</p>

<p>
The night passed uneventfully.
</p>

<p>
At midnight Mr. Sennit, the chief officer, and his
men took over control, but although Archer and
Sorter were also called neither of them seemed
willing to leave their warm beds until fairly driven
out by the mate.
</p>

<p>
Jack and Wilton were soon asleep, yet only a few
moments seemed to have elapsed before they were
again called to keep the morning watch.
</p>

<p>
Scarcely more than half awake both boys
stumbled aft, and despite their warm jackets
each felt the keen winter breeze sufficiently
chilling.
</p>

<p>
'Ugh!' Wilton exclaimed, 'I thought our run
down Channel was bad enough, but this is worse.
Had I known that we should be compelled to stand
watches at night, I should not have come.  I'm
almost sick of the life already.'
</p>

<p>
'Perhaps Captain Thorne will put you on a
homeward-bound ship,' Jack laughingly replied;
'cheer up, lad! it is certainly quite different from
what we have been accustomed to; but, like
everything else that is strange and a little trying,
you will soon get used to it.  At anyrate, it is your
first spell at the bell-ringing, and I shall sit on the
companion stairs ready for a call.'
</p>

<p>
At five o'clock the cook sang out 'Coffee,' and
when Jack had swallowed his allowance Wilton was
relieved.
</p>

<p>
After that matters sensibly improved.
</p>

<p>
Dawn showed eastward, the male emigrants down
below turned out to receive their daily allowances of
fresh water, served by the purser, and at six o'clock
the watch began the first duty of washing the decks
fore and aft.
</p>

<p>
Assisted by a young ordinary seaman the
boys were employed at filling the saloon water
tank, and at eight o'clock both went below for
breakfast.
</p>

<p>
To their astonishment all the occupants of the
second cabin appeared greatly excited, and it
presently turned out that a large box, which they
had filled with certain food luxuries the ship did not
supply, had been completely emptied during the
night.
</p>

<p>
'Everything was quite safe when I locked the box
last night and gave the key to that gentleman,' the
perplexed steward cried, while indicating one of the
passengers.
</p>

<p>
'And I have lost my watch!' a lady exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
'And I a fine revolver!' a young man added.
</p>

<p>
The losses were immediately reported to the
captain, and searching investigation followed, but no
trace of the thief could be obtained; and it was not
until the voyage out had terminated that the mystery
was cleared up.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, however, the unfortunate holder of
the rifled box key determined to keep watch by
night, hoping to catch the miscreant red-handed, and
in that effort he was joined by the young man who
had lost the revolver.
</p>

<p>
Both accordingly secreted themselves beneath the
cabin table, but it was not long before another
'detective' of the watch on deck discovered them.
The finder calling his mates, the crew set on their
victims with such zeal that the whole ship was
aroused, and much commotion ensued.
</p>

<p>
Some of the alarmed people cried 'Fire!' while
others declared that the clipper had been in collision
with a passing vessel, and it was with great difficulty
that order was restored.
</p>

<p>
The 'Silver Crown' made steady progress
southward.  The breeze remained favourable, and
the temperature slowly rose.
</p>

<p>
The Bay of Biscay was left far astern, and within
a week the latitude of Madeira was reached.
</p>

<p>
There the first breath of the steady north-east
trade wind was felt, and as it strengthened, all the
topmast and topgallant studding-sail booms were
sent aloft, and their gear was rove.  The canvas was
also 'bent,' or fastened to the yards, and to the
ever-cheery sea chanty:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'What shall we do with the drunken sailor,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Early in the morning?<br />
  Put him in the tar pot till he gets sober,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Early in the morning,'<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
many young Irish emigrants seized the halyards,
and with right good will tugged at them like horses.
Ropes and patent blocks hummed to the strain.  In
great balloon-like clouds the studding-sails, far beyond
the standing yardarms, swelled out magnificently in
the fresh breeze.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Statten sang out 'Belay'; tacks and sheets
were hauled taut, and, with two knots an hour added
to the pace, the beautiful ship raced along like a
yacht, with her head ever pointing southward.
</p>

<p>
The weather had now become delightful.  The
keen northern winds had disappeared, all day long a
brilliant and unclouded sun filled ocean and sky with
increasing warmth.  All manner of amusements were
now devised by the passengers to while away the
long hours of daylight, and although most of the
games proved very popular, none seemed to take
such permanent hold as the 'evening concerts' given
by the watch on deck when 'sucking the bilges dry'
at the close of each day.
</p>

<p>
As many people as could find room at the pump
brakes always assisted the sailors, yet none of the
old sea songs ever proved so entertaining as one that
was composed by the ship's poet, a young ordinary
seaman, the first three verses of it being now made
public.  The song was named&mdash;

<h3>
CHAPTER III
<br /><br />
WITHIN THE TROPICS
</h3>

<p>
The 'Silver Crown' was now in the midst of the
steady north-east trade wind, the anchors had
been taken in-board and secured on the
forecastle-head, the cables were stowed away in
their respective lockers, while the plugging of the
hawse-pipes rendered the forecastle itself more
comfortable and dry for the crew.  With lower,
topmast, topgallant, and even royal studding-sails
swelling out bravely on the fresh breeze the clipper
maintained her reputation for fast sailing, each day's
run finding her drawing nearer the 'doldrums,' or the
calm belts situated on either side of the equator.
</p>

<p>
Every hour of those lovely days brought fresh
attractions and delight to Jack Clewlin, who never
wearied of watching the shoals of flying-fish rise
above the sea, and with extended 'wings' speed off
to leeward.
</p>

<p>
Bonito, skip-jack, dolphin, and the gracefully-moving
porpoise, gambolled fearlessly under the bow,
now momentarily disappearing in the fringe of foam
cast up by the cleaving cut-water, or forging far
ahead without apparent effort.
</p>

<p>
The scene was sufficiently striking, and well
calculated to impress itself on a young and imaginative
mind, while the whole was brilliantly illuminated by
a cloudless sun set in a dome of exquisite blue.
</p>

<p>
From the topgallant forecastle-head a fairly good
view of the speeding vessel could be obtained, but the
best point from which to see her was the jib-boom
end, and although Jack felt inclined to climb out
there, he was not permitted to do so.
</p>

<p>
'No, no, Master Jack,' one of the quarter-masters,
named Readyman, exclaimed; 'a few months ahead
you may try that.  A slip of hand or foot now would
end all your voyaging, and how could I send your
dad such news?'
</p>

<p>
'Do you know my father?' Jack eagerly inquired.
</p>

<p>
'Ay, lad, and sailed with him too, long before you
were born!  Directly I saw him here I knew him
again, and promised to keep an eye on you.'
</p>

<p>
At that moment a cry from amongst the swelling
canvas aloft reached the deck.
</p>

<p>
'There they blow!'
</p>

<p>
The boy at first failed to see anything, although he
knew that whales must be in sight.
</p>

<p>
It was not long, however, before Readyman pointed
out several dark specks just awash off the port-quarter,
and fast overhauling the clipper, despite her ten
knots an hour.
</p>

<p>
As they drew closer Jack perceived several jets
of spray suddenly rise above the water.
</p>

<p>
'They are playing,' the quarter-master explained,
'and only live in warm latitudes.  We call them
"bottle-noses."'
</p>

<p>
'Is it not wonderful how many strange creatures
there are in the sea, Readyman?' Jack said.
</p>

<p>
'It is indeed, Master Jack,' the quarter-master
replied; 'I have often thought so, and tried to guess
what some of them were made for.'
</p>

<p>
Like war-ships in line ahead the bottle-noses
approached still closer.
</p>

<p>
'They will strike us!' Jack cried.
</p>

<p>
'No, no, you need not fear that,' Readyman said;
'they are more scared of you than you could be
of them.  Directly they see the vessel they'll dive.'
</p>

<p>
Almost immediately their leader did so, and, sinking
fathoms deep beneath the keel of the speeding
clipper, all disappeared, but were soon seen far
off to starboard.
</p>

<p>
The steady wind proved so favourable that
considerable progress was made, but by degrees
it began to slacken, until at last the 'Silver Crown'
was left wholly becalmed within the 'doldrums.'
</p>

<p>
The heat had now become most oppressive,
especially for those obliged to sleep under decks,
but the captain ordered several 'windsails' to be
rigged up fore and aft, and their long, tubular bodies
were dropped below, so that the slightest breath of
passing airs might be directed into the 'tween and
orlop, or lower decks.  The crew, too, whistled for
a breeze that might take all hands out of such
discomfort.
</p>

<p>
Yet day after day the vessel remained unassisted on
the glittering sea; the pitch oozed in black bubbles
from the main deck seams; the yards were constantly
swung to catch the slightest 'cat's-paw' of air; the
timbers fore and aft groaned unceasingly, and the
rigging and the canvas suffered chafe as the hull
rolled helplessly on the equatorial ocean.
</p>

<p>
Occasionally a downpour of rain tended to cool
the stifling atmosphere, but as it ceased the heat
seemed to increase.
</p>

<p>
Water-spouts were frequently observed forming on
the horizon, but most fortunately none of them came
near the ship.
</p>

<p>
Some of the gentlemen suggested bathing.  Captain
Thorne, however, would not permit even a sail to
be used for that purpose, since several sharks were
suddenly perceived within a few fathoms.  Next day
he made a cheering announcement.
</p>

<p>
'The ship will cross the line at noon,' he said.
</p>

<p>
That event had been eagerly awaited by the
passengers.
</p>

<p>
It was understood that 'King Neptune' would pay
them a visit, and such an event would divert attention
from a trying existence beneath an almost vertical
sun.
</p>

<p>
The sailors immediately became the busiest of all
on board, and much reticence was observed by them.
</p>

<p>
As the interesting moment approached, the skipper
kindly permitted many people to peer through his
telescope, across which a hair had been artfully
fastened, at the 'line' otherwise invisible to an
ordinary eye.
</p>

<p>
With the making of eight bells, noon, a blast on the
fog-horn announced the arrival of a stranger from
'over the bow,' and in loud voice he hailed the ship,
wishing to know her name, whither she was bound,
and if the captain desired the presence of his master
King Neptune.
</p>

<p>
Through his speaking-trumpet the skipper made
the necessary replies.
</p>

<p>
Immediately afterwards Neptune himself appeared
on the forecastle head.  He was a burly, dignified
old fellow in fantastic attire.  His touzled hair and
great white beard hung below the shoulders and
waist, while his arms and lower limbs were exposed,
and in the right hand he held a trident.
</p>

<p>
His arrival was greeted with rounds of cheering,
and much hand-shaking followed, while his trusty
'barber,' laden with an enormous shaving-pot,
lathering brush, and large-sized razor, also came in
for a good deal of notice.
</p>

<p>
Accompanied by several retainers, the 'King'
reached the main deck.  On his mounting a
strangely caparisoned steed the animal was
distinctly heard to observe, 'If old Bill don't sit
farther aft, my back-bone will part amidships.'
</p>

<p>
Surrounded by an admiring throng, Neptune
moved aft and wished Captain Thorne and all his
people a safe voyage.
</p>

<p>
His assistants lost no time in getting to work.
</p>

<p>
A young ordinary seaman was seized and placed
in a chair.  His face was covered with a soapy
mixture, but, when he objected to the bluntness of
the razor, his mouth was filled with soap.  Then,
suddenly losing his balance, he fell backward into
a large water-filled deck tub.
</p>

<p>
Other 'greenhorns,' who had not previously
crossed the equator, received similar attentions, but,
thanks to the watchfulness of his friend Readyman,
Jack escaped notice.
</p>

<p>
Some of the young emigrants, however, presently
found the sharp eye of Neptune bent on them, and
taking to the rigging for safety, they were compelled
to 'pay their footing' in lieu of a shave.
</p>

<p>
The utmost good humour prevailed, but before
Neptune retired the amused passengers witnessed
yet another strange custom, which, alas! is fast
dying out, if not wholly forgotten by present day
British sailors.
</p>

<p>
With some ceremony the crew brought aft the
effigy of a horse, which was fastened to a rope that
ran through a block at the main yardarm.
</p>

<p>
The interested and curious spectators closed round
the seamen.  All being ready, two of the latter
seized the rope, and as the 'animal' ascended the
hands sang the old sea chanty:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'I say, old man, your horse must die,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We say so, and we hope so.<br />
  I say, old man, your horse must die:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, poor old man.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  But should he live we'll ride him ag'in,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We say so, and we hope so.<br />
  And if he dies we'll tan his skin:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, poor old man.'<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The figure was thus hauled out to the yardarm,
and being cut adrift fell into the sea, where it was
several times dragged below the surface, but always
released, by inquisitive sharks.
</p>

<p>
The meaning of that procedure was, that on that
day the crew had completed one month's work in
lieu of the advance of money obtained on signing
articles, and having thus 'worked off the dead horse,'
as the debt is styled, they would now be earning
wages.  Captain Thorne addressed all hands.
</p>

<p>
'You will remember,' he said, 'that this day, the
tenth of March, is not alone made memorable by
our crossing of the line, but that, in London, His
Royal Highness, Albert Edward, Prince of Wales,
and the Princess Alexandra of Denmark, become
husband and wife.  God bless them!  I call for
three cheers; and three more for our beloved
Sovereign, Queen Victoria, who, since her occupation
of the British throne, has endeared herself to her
people.  God bless her too!  Hip, hip, hurrah!'
</p>

<p>
The simple words touched the hearts of the
assembled throng.  Many a husband and wife
recalled their own wedding-day, and up rose a
succession of heart-stirring cheers.
</p>

<p>
The clipper, momentarily steadied on an even
keel, seemed to listen too, and tremble under the
outburst.
</p>

<p>
'Well done, and I thank you all,' the captain said.
And thus ended that crossing of the line on board the
'Silver Crown.'
</p>

<p>
A few days later the first breath of the
anxiously awaited south-east trade wind struck
the vessel.
</p>

<p>
The drooping royals began to flutter and then to
fill, the topgallant-sails soon imitated that effort, and
the hull once more answered its helm.
</p>

<p>
The heavy topsails and lower courses soon filled
out.  The hands were called to the braces, and with
yards braced sharp up to an increasing breeze, the
'Silver Crown' drew away from those windless
regions surrounding the equator.
</p>

<p>
Within one week she had made such progress
that the temperature fell considerably, and refreshing
sleep could be once more enjoyed by all.
</p>

<p>
But about that time Jack Clewlin fell into
temporary disgrace with the chief officer.
</p>

<p>
Throughout the first portion of the voyage its
many attractions kept the lad fully alive to the
charm of sea experiences, and what with that and
the miseries of the 'middle passage' he found it
impossible to obtain the proper amount of sleep.
</p>

<p>
Now all that inconvenience had disappeared.  The
nights were becoming delightfully cooler, and tired
Nature, determined to make up all arrears of
sleep, cast on Jack her soothing and irresistible
influence.
</p>

<p>
He battled stoutly against it while on duty, and
in semi-wakefulness paced the deck until sudden
collision with the bulwarks, or the saloon door,
almost sent him to the deck.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, that duty of night watching proved
almost insurmountable.  On the occasion to which
reference has been made, it fell to his lot to keep the
bells going from ten o'clock till midnight.
</p>

<p>
For a while all went well.
</p>

<p>
At eight bells Mr. Sennit, the chief officer, was
called.  He never took more than three minutes to
relieve the deck, and on doing so he invariably
looked at the clock in the saloon skylight.  This
night he acted as usual, and immediately became
angry.
</p>

<p>
'Who made eight bells?' he sharply inquired.
</p>

<p>
'I, sir,' Jack replied, but never suspecting that
anything could be amiss.
</p>

<p>
'Lay aft here, two hands, and clew the mizen
royal up,' the mate sang out on the watch.  'You
young booby,' he added, 'I'll teach you not to
call me twenty minutes before my time.  Up
you go and stow that sail, and be smart about it
too.'
</p>

<p>
Jack was now thoroughly wide awake, and on
looking at the clock found that it still wanted
quarter of an hour to midnight.
</p>

<p>
That small sail fluttering in the breeze far aloft
occasioned much regret.  However, he scrambled
into the lower mizen rigging, and getting through
the 'lubber's hole' of the top climbed the topmast
rigging, reached the crosstrees, and presently stood
on the foot-rope of the royal yard.
</p>

<p>
How to stow the sail he did not know.  Never
mind!  All that would come later, and the time was
his own.
</p>

<p>
At present he felt sufficiently proud of having
accomplished what he had not dared to attempt in
broad daylight.
</p>

<p>
The pure life-giving sea breeze filled his young
lungs till a shout of boyish delight could scarcely be
repressed.
</p>

<p>
And what a magnificent spectacle lay spread out
before him!  On every hand, and far as the eye
could see, a vast expanse of ocean lay glittering in
the silvery radiance of an almost full moon.
</p>

<p>
The long narrow hull of the clipper loomed in
patches of brilliant moonlight and deep shadows
cast by the towering canvas.
</p>

<p>
The big main topgallant-sail, and the large main
royal rose in front far above his own level, and away
astern he could see the phosphorescent track of the
ship distinctly marked.
</p>

<p>
Never before had he seen so lovely a spectacle.
</p>

<p>
Jack began to hum the air of an old sea song
learned at home:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Oh, wonder not that next to thee<br />
  I love the galloping wave.<br />
  The first of coursers wild and free,<br />
  And only carries the brave.<br />
  She's a gallant ship, with gallant crew,<br />
  Then, mother, be proud of your boy in blue.'<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
A sharp and stern hail reached him.
</p>

<p>
'Royal yard, there, are you going to furl that
sail?'
</p>

<p>
'Ay, ay, sir,' he replied.
</p>

<p>
Rightly judging that some loosely fastened
cordage, named gaskets, was for wrapping round
the yard and sail, Jack used it, and 'picking up'
the centre portion of the canvas he stowed it
as best he could, and speedily returned to the
deck.
</p>

<p>
The royal had not been stowed in shipshape
fashion, yet it passed muster, and the lad presently
discovered that he had spent nearly half his watch on
the yard.
</p>

<p>
'You were asleep when making eight bells, Clewlin,'
the mate observed.
</p>

<p>
'I must have been, sir,' Jack replied.  'It will not
occur again.'
</p>

<p>
'If it does, you shall try your hand at the big
main royal,' the officer returned.  'Get to your
bunk.'
</p>

<p>
Alarmed by the threat, Jack disappeared.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap04"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IV
<br /><br />
UNDER THE SOUTHERN CROSS
</h3>

<p>
After that memorable night ascent, Jack
never hesitated to go aloft on all occasions.
</p>

<p>
For a while, however, he could not overcome
the difficulties of climbing out over the 'futtock'
rigging of the lower tops, and was too proud to
again creep through the 'lubber's hole,' yet with
advice from Readyman those obstacles were
surmounted.
</p>

<p>
'Wait until the ship rolls away from you,' the
quarter-master said, 'and then you'll find that she
almost lifts you into the topmast rigging.'
</p>

<p>
Finding the boy an apt pupil, Readyman put him
through a course of 'eye,' 'long,' 'short,' and 'cringle'
splicing of ropes, and the correct formation of
numerous knots and hitches.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, the old sailor proved of invaluable service
to the lad, and taught him many other duties which
no one else seemed to have the time or the inclination
to impart, and before the passengers went ashore
Jack was well up in the rudiments of his profession.
In return for such kindness the boy was enabled to
render his friend much pleasurable assistance, and in
a manner little suspected by the quarter-master.
</p>

<p>
Readyman could neither read nor write, but being
of a most thoughtful turn of mind, he gladly seized
the offer of his young friend to read some portions of
the Bible whenever occasion offered.
</p>

<p>
'I'd like it well, Master Jack,' he said; 'some ships
I've sailed in always held Sunday services, and all
the men used to attend.  Of course, they have
meetings in the saloon, but I couldn't go there.'
</p>

<p>
'There are others held in the 'tween deck,' Jack
returned.  'I have always gone down there on Sunday
mornings.'
</p>

<p>
'Ay, ay, my son, but where you may go I dared
not be seen.  You know how strictly we are bidden
to keep away from the passengers, and orders must
be obeyed.'
</p>

<p>
'Well, Readyman,' Jack said, 'we must make up
a little meeting of our own.  I promised my father
to read some of the Bible every day, and although
at first there was some annoyance from Sorter, I have
done so without fear.'
</p>

<p>
'Well done, sonny,' the quarter-master exclaimed.
'Stick to that all the time.  It's the best book you
can read, and no harm can come of doing so.  But,
harkee, lad!  Don't have anything to say or to do
with that rascal Sorter.  He is no good.  Do not
let on that I told you anything, but we in the
"fo'c's'le" hear a good deal of what is happening,
and some of the hands are almost certain, although
nothing positive can be ascertained, that he has had
a finger in the robberies from the second cabin.  I
see him prowling about the fore-peak a good deal,
and the young men there don't think much of him.'
</p>

<p>
Jack expressed much surprise at what he had been
told, but he immediately fetched his Bible, and
although debarred from entering the men's quarters,
he and Readyman stowed themselves away comfortably
on the topgallant forecastle-head, and the old
sailor listened to the passages read to him.  Indeed,
it was not long before other men, attracted to the
spot by sheer curiosity, sat down to listen, and
remained in respectful attention to the close of the
watch.  Many similar readings were given, and no
one interfered.
</p>

<p>
The 'Silver Crown' was daily drawing southward
into more salubrious weather, and in due course she
sighted the coast of South America in the neighbourhood
of Pernambuco.
</p>

<p>
Then she tacked, and stood off toward the Cape
of Good Hope.  Shortly after breakfast next morning
a hand aloft sang out 'Sail, O!' and within an hour
the stranger became clearly visible.  She proved to
be the 'Merrie England,' owned by the same firm,
and she had left the Thames with emigrants for
Queensland some days before the 'Silver Crown'
left Stonewell.
</p>

<p>
She was hailed with ringing cheers, and, in hope of
speedily outsailing her, everyone offered their services
in bracing the yards, setting up the canvas, and
other duties.
</p>

<p>
An intensely exciting struggle for supremacy
ensued.  Up to that time the 'Merrie England' had
been considered the fastest vessel in the company's
service, and although Captain Thorne had long
desired to try conclusions with her, he had never
been successful.
</p>

<p>
Now, however, his opportunity had come, and he
was determined to test the sailing qualities of both
ships in fair seaman-like manner.
</p>

<p>
The challenged captain, fully aware of his
opponent's intentions, did everything possible to
avoid defeat, and hoisting his colours in token of
acceptance, he immediately endeavoured to secure
the weather berth.
</p>

<p>
But Captain Thorne held it, while seizing the main
tack, and to the strains of
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Haul the bowline, the packet ship's a-rolling;<br />
  Haul the bowline, the bowline ... Haul!'<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Many young emigrants dragged the great clew of
the mainsail nearly down to the chestrees, and the
boatswain cried 'Belay all!' the fore and the main
bowlines were also rove and hauled out, the jibs
were set up, and the 'Silver Crown' stood up
splendidly in the fresh breeze.
</p>

<p>
Of course, all the passengers were by that time on
deck, cheers were given and returned, and the
beautiful clipper still drew closer to her equally
fast-looking rival.
</p>

<p>
She was now almost on her best sailing point, and
could always be trusted to pass anything less able to
hold its wind.  With colours flying from masthead
and gaff-end, and jets of glittering spray sometimes
leaping high over the forecastle-head, she drew up on
the weather quarter of her rival.  For a few anxious
moments she seemed to hang stationary in that
position, till an increasing wind laid her still deeper
on the port-bilge.  Then gathering fresh impetus for
the final struggle she forged ahead, took the wind
completely out of her opponent's canvas, and
sweeping forward passed her in magnificent style.
</p>

<p>
A tremendous outburst of cheering greeted the
performance.  When well clear Captain Thorne
sheered to leeward, and allowed his competitor to
pass ahead, but directly she was clear he again
'luffed' into the wind, and completed a circle round
his fairly beaten rival.
</p>

<p>
'Throw us a line and we'll give you a tow!'
</p>

<p>
'We'll tell them at Brisbane you're coming!'
</p>

<p>
'Why don't your cook get up more steam?'
</p>

<p>
These were a few of the taunts flung at the defeated
vessel, while the sporting instincts of the Irish
emigrants found vent in one deafening
'cock-ee-doo-dle-doo-oo-oo-oo.'
</p>

<p>
There was no reply to that vociferous challenge.
The 'Silver Crown' had proved herself the fastest
vessel in the service, and as night closed down the
'Merrie England' disappeared.  Careening gracefully
to the increasing breeze, the clipper held her
close-hauled course.
</p>

<p>
Every inch of canvas, excepting the studding-sails,
was set, and the staysails, or those between the masts
and shaped like the jibs, pulled strongly at their
sheets.
</p>

<p>
The temperature had now fallen to a healthy and
bracing level.  When a safe distance from the South
American coast was reached the ship again tacked,
and stood toward the south-west.
</p>

<p>
One afternoon Readyman accosted his young
pupil.
</p>

<p>
'You are coming on well with the knotting and
splicing, Master Jack,' he said.  'I now think that
you should learn to "box" the compass.'
</p>

<p>
'That refers to the steering, doesn't it?' Jack
inquired.
</p>

<p>
'Yes, lad, and the sooner you know the card the
sooner you may be permitted to steer.  Not that the
captain would allow that just at present, but if he
asked you questions, you could answer correctly, and
that would mean a deal.'
</p>

<p>
The rough drawing of a compass card was produced,
and the lesson began.
</p>

<p>
'I made it myself,' the quarter-master said.  'We'll
work round from north to east first.  Now, listen to
me.  North, north-by-east, north-north-east,
north-east-by-north, north-east, north-east-by-east,
east-north-east, east-by-north, east.  When those points
are well learned the rest is easy.  All you need do is
to alter north into south, and east into west.  It is
quite simple when you put your whole mind into the
lesson for a few minutes.  You see that the circle is
divided into four quarters, and that each of them
is sub-divided into eight points, the whole thus
numbering thirty-two points.'
</p>

<p>
'Thanks, Readyman,' Jack replied.  'You are very
kind to me.'
</p>

<p>
'Kind, lad?' the other exclaimed.  'Why, I haven't
been half so kind as your father was to me.  Did you
ever hear how he saved my life, when no one could
have believed it possible?'
</p>

<p>
'No,' Jack returned.  'Tell me the story, please.'
</p>

<p>
'It happened years ago, long before you were
born,' the quarter-master said.  'I was bo's'n of the
barque "Isabella," and your dad was her first mate.
We were on the China coast.  While between
Shanghai and Hong Kong we were struck by a
terrible typhoon; we managed to get the topgallant-masts
on deck, and reefed everything fore and aft.
</p>

<p>
'That did not seem much good, for within an hour
all the spars above the lower masts went over the
side like matchwood.
</p>

<p>
'The sea ran awful high, and the barque was
knocked about like a toy.  Away she flew before the
wind, steering wild on account of the sea, but
remaining fairly dry, as she was in ballast trim.
</p>

<p>
'During that afternoon we fell in with a deep-laden
French vessel also scudding, and showing signals of
distress, but nothing could be done to send assistance.
</p>

<p>
'We thought ourselves badly off, but were quite
comfortable when compared with those poor Frenchies.
Every sea swept their decks, and those not already
washed away had taken to the after rigging.  We
could see a hand at the helm, but as the old "Isabella"
ran three knots to their one we soon lost sight of the
ship.  And she was never heard of again.
</p>

<p>
'I hope you'll never see such a thing, Master Jack.
When one of those "busters" come along it's only by
the merest chance that anyone pulls through it with
his life, or, at anyrate, with unbroken limbs.
</p>

<p>
'Well, lad, we were so beaten with wind, and
knocked about by the sea, that it wasn't long before
the carpenter sounded the "well," and holding up three
fingers, for no one could hear a word shouted in their
ear, he signalled three feet of water down below.
</p>

<p>
'Your father began to work his arms, as much as to
say, "All hands to the pumps!" and we got them
working fairly well.
</p>

<p>
'All of a sudden, lad, she broached to, and afore
you could sing out "Belay!" a tremendous wave swept
the deck, and the wind dropped.  It was almost calm.
From another point it burst out worse than ever, and
the cross sea thus raised was something awful.  None
of us had seen anything like it, and as for the old
barque she could make nothing of such a smother.
</p>

<p>
'One fearful big wave gripped her by the bow, and
another seized the stern.  When they let go she had
been twisted like paper, and on her beam-ends fell
into the trough of the sea.
</p>

<p>
'We left the pumps and lashed ourselves to the
mizen rigging.  The rudder had been carried away.
</p>

<p>
'The skipper looked pretty sad&mdash;maybe he was
thinking of his family at home.  Anyhow, sonny, he
waved his arms, as if to say, "It's all over with us,
men!"  At that moment a terrible sea broke in over
the port beam, swept the deck fore and aft, and stove
in the main hatch.
</p>

<p>
'In the thick spume and rain no one could see
much, while the salt clinging in our eyes blinded most
of the men.
</p>

<p>
'It was coming on dark.  The barque was lifted to
the top of a great billow, and then fell nearly straight
down to the bottom of the hollow, where it was
almost calm.
</p>

<p>
'Then, with rush of water and scream of wind, she
rose to the summit of another wave, and was instantly
hurled on to a reef, over which the sea boiled a
thousand times worse than out in the open.  Of what
next happened I have but dim recollection.
</p>

<p>
'The wreck was swept off the reef, and all hands
seemed to go down together.  I began to choke, but
suddenly felt the wind again in my face, and I
thought someone near was singing out, but who it
could be there was no telling in the utter blackness
of that night.
</p>

<p>
'I fancied the typhoon was not quite so strong as it
had been, and feeling a rope still fast round my waist
I naturally thought I was secured to the mizen
rigging.  But instead of the shrouds my hand struck
timber.  That seemed to wake me up a bit, and I
then discovered that your dad was alongside, and that
both of us were lashed up to the mizen mast head, but
how such a change of position was made I could not
imagine.  Of the remainder of the hands there was no
trace.  Anyhow, lad, you may think I'm yarning, yet
it's true all the same, <i>your father was asleep
alongside of me</i>, for all the world as though nothing
particular had happened, or that both of us might be
drowned at any moment.
</p>

<p>
'Good man! he was exhausted after saving someone
for company, and lucky was it for me that he did so.
As I afterwards found out, he cut both our lashings
when the wreck fell off the reef, and finding that the
mast remained upright, with a portion of the hull
attached, so that it stood a few feet out of water, he
grabbed me, and lashing himself to the support went
to sleep.
</p>

<p>
'Next morning the typhoon had passed away, but
the sea remained cross and high.
</p>

<p>
'Through it all that good old stick swam bravely,
and after a while your father woke up, looking ten
years older than he had done two days before.
</p>

<p>
'Some hours later a partly dismantled vessel, that
had managed to steer clear of the 'heft' of the blow,
picked us up, and we were finally set ashore at Hong
Kong.  That's the yarn, sonny.'
</p>

<p>
'Thanks, Readyman,' Jack replied.  'It was a
fearful experience, but I never heard my father tell
the story.'
</p>

<p>
'That was just his way, lad,' the quarter-master
returned.  'If I had saved him, you'd never hear the
end on't, but about himself there'd never be one
word.'
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER V
<br /><br />
DOWN IN THE 'ROLLING FORTIES'
</h3>

<p>
A week later, and on taking over the morning
watch, Jack was delighted to find that during
the night several black-and-white speckled
birds, styled 'cape pigeons,' were following the ship.
All that day the beautiful little creatures continued
to arrive in large flocks, and it did not require any
stretch of imagination to believe that, as Jack Clewlin
said, 'a feathered snowsquall was driving up astern.'
</p>

<p>
They flew quite close to the ship, their beady
black eyes always on the watch for anything thrown
overboard, and their shrill cries of delight or
disappointment mingled with the ceaseless 'boom
boom' of the rolling waves.
</p>

<p>
One of the saloon passengers immediately
determined to shoot some of the birds.
</p>

<p>
Captain Thorne raised strong objections, and also
added that to do so would be inviting misfortune
on the ship, or to some of the people on board.
</p>

<p>
The younger and less thoughtful of his hearers
laughed at 'the funny sailor superstition.'
</p>

<p>
Before more could be said, however, the 'sportsman'
raised his fowling-piece, and in rapid succession
brought down two of the birds.
</p>

<p>
The indignation of the captain was withering.
</p>

<p>
'You should be ashamed of yourself, sir!' he hotly
exclaimed.  'People such as you never seem happy
unless they are killing or maiming the most beautiful
of God's creatures.  What harm did those little birds
do you?  Your selfishness is appalling, for you cannot
even recover what you kill.  With all your boasted
cleverness you are not able to restore the life in
what the Almighty has placed on this sea for His
own wise purposes.'
</p>

<p>
The captain spoke with considerable feeling, and
no more birds were slain.  Some of the passengers
who had been quickest to ridicule the idea that it
would be unlucky to shoot the birds now looked
somewhat shamefaced, and also realised that not
only was it a wanton destruction of life, but that the
entire crew seemed deeply offended.
</p>

<p>
Day by day the 'Silver Crown' drew farther
southward, and the weather became correspondingly
stronger and colder.  The sea, too, began to run
with considerable weight, and the westerly wind
steadily increased.
</p>

<p>
The ship made daily runs of extraordinary
distances, the outlook was beautifully clear, and the
sky of a vivid steel-blue hue.  In short, she had now
reached that portion of the ocean known to mariners
as the 'rolling forties,' since below the latitude of
forty degrees south, and as nowhere else are such
steady winds obtainable, the masters of all vessels
bound toward Australia, New Zealand, or Tasmania,
seize the opportunity of 'running their easting down,'
in other words, keeping an almost due easterly course.
</p>

<p>
And then it was that the only accident, a disaster,
in fact, of appalling suddenness, marred the
otherwise successful voyage of the 'Silver Crown,' and
cast a deep gloom over everyone on board.
</p>

<p>
One bright but cold Saturday morning the ship
raced along at about fourteen knots an hour, every
inch of her best and newest canvas swelling out
magnificently in the strong wind, and broad bands
of seething foam leaped and hissed on either side.
</p>

<p>
The middle and after staysails, or those between
the masts, were kept set, but owing to the heavy
'send' of the sea, and the consequent swing of the
hull, they were not always full, and, of course,
the sheets, or such ropes as held down the lower
corners of those triangular-shaped sails, lay useless
until again strained by the wind.
</p>

<p>
All the female steerage passengers were turned up
on deck for the customary weekly clothes wash,
and with their tubs stood along each side of the
deck.
</p>

<p>
Beside them husbands, sons, or brothers, supplied
the water, which was drawn from the sea in small
pails supplied for that purpose.
</p>

<p>
For a while all went well, and merry laughter and
chatter prevailed fore and aft the main deck.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly the appalling cry 'Man overboard!'
arose.
</p>

<p>
The captain rushed on deck, and the helm was
jammed hard down.  The ship immediately swung
into the wind without shipping much water.  The
sails beat heavily in the strong wind, the crew rushed
to the braces, ropes whizzed through their blocks,
a lifebuoy was flung astern, and when the yards had
been steadied the lee lifeboat, in charge of Mr. Statten,
got safely away from the ship.
</p>

<p>
By that time Captain Thorne had reached the
mizen top, and through his glasses sought trace of
the unfortunate man, but all he could see were some
albatrosses, which were following the vessel, hovering
above a spot far to windward.
</p>

<p>
The boat reached the place, but only brought
back the buoy.  As nothing more could be done,
the 'Silver Crown' resumed her voyage.
</p>

<p>
'Who has gone?' was the general inquiry.
</p>

<p>
No one could tell.  The mate called over the
muster-roll of the crew, and each man answered
to his name.
</p>

<p>
It was evident that one of the emigrants had been
the victim.  When his name was called, and there
was no reply, his wife declared that he was below
collecting clothes for the wash.  On discovering her
mistake, she fell into a swoon, and on regaining
her senses she became almost beside herself with
grief.
</p>

<p>
It subsequently appeared that her husband,
although frequently warned to keep clear of the big
main topmast staysail sheet, had leaned across it to
draw water while the sail was empty, and when the
latter suddenly filled he was, of course, flung several
feet clear of the racing hull.
</p>

<p>
Six children mourned his loss, while, to make
matters still worse, every penny possessed by the
unfortunate family was sewn into the lining of an
overcoat which the man then wore.
</p>

<p>
After arrival at Brisbane the whole family was
sent back to England, for the mother had become
strange in her mind.
</p>

<p>
Well, the topgallant-sails and the royals were
reset, a short funeral service was held, and
throughout the remainder of that day a deep hush
prevailed fore and aft.
</p>

<p>
On flew the clipper before the wind, and many
large albatrosses followed in the wake.
</p>

<p>
Most of those beautiful birds must have measured
quite eight feet from tip to tip of their extended wings,
yet whether going with or against the wind no one
could detect the slightest movement of their pinions.
</p>

<p>
Like the 'cape pigeons' nothing escaped their
vigilant scrutiny, and shrill screams, and a splash of
grey-coloured feathers in the cold sea, followed the
throwing of anything overboard.
</p>

<p>
By hook and line one of them was captured, yet
not without considerable trouble, since with
outspread wings and webbed feet thrust rigidly against
the water, it required the strength of two men to
haul it on board.
</p>

<p>
It struck out savagely with its strong hooked beak,
and as it was too heavy to rise from the deck it
became seasick; yet when released it immediately
soared aloft, as before its capture.
</p>

<p>
The clipper continued to race along in magnificent
manner, and runs of four hundred miles were frequent.
Sometimes the heavy seas rolling up astern
threatened to fall on board, but with upward rise of
the bow she always sped clear of the danger.
</p>

<p>
At last she began to edge northward out of the
strong weather.  The temperature rose considerably.
The albatrosses disappeared.
</p>

<p>
All hands set to work holy stoning the deck and
painting ship.  The cables were dragged from below
and secured to the anchors, which were hove out over
the bows.
</p>

<p>
In short, the voyage of the 'Silver Crown' was
drawing to a close.  Everything not required for
daily use was packed away by the passengers for
removal ashore, and a keen lookout for land was
observed.
</p>

<p>
Shortly after dawn one morning Mr. Statten, the
second mate, ordered Jack Clewlin to 'jump aloft
and have a look round.'
</p>

<p>
Within a few minutes the excited lad had reached
the fore topmast crosstrees.
</p>

<p>
There he took time to recover his breath, and then
thrusting his cap within his shirt for safety he
'shinned' up the royal rigging.
</p>

<p>
With the slender mast pole six feet above his head
he sat on the yard.
</p>

<p>
A splendid spectacle rewarded his climb.
</p>

<p>
Right away to the distant horizon all round, the
deep blue and white-ridged ocean lay beneath the
increasing daylight.
</p>

<p>
Far below the head canvas pulled strongly at its
boom, the sharp bow cut through the water like a
knife, surging foam seemed to leap almost to the
cat-heads, and never a sail stirred in the wind.
</p>

<p>
He thought of that first night ascent, and the
beautiful scene then witnessed, yet now a scarcely
less exquisite light that always precedes sunrise at
sea prevailed.
</p>

<p>
With one arm flung round the mast for security
Jack peered ahead.
</p>

<p>
As the light strengthened a dim blue haze seemed
to hang just above the horizon far ahead.
</p>

<p>
It seemed exactly like the first loom of the South
American continent.  As it did not rise so rapidly as
vapour would, Jack mustered up all his courage for the
grand announcement, and in clear, boyish tones he
hailed the deck&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'Land, ho!'
</p>

<p>
His heart beat quickly.  Had he been too hasty?
He peered at the deepening haze, and then saw
Mr. Statten in the crosstrees beneath him.
</p>

<p>
'All right, Clewlin,' the mate sang out; 'that's
the land.  Come down here and keep bright lookout
for broken water.  The royals will be lowered
directly.'
</p>

<p>
Jack breathed more freely.  He had made no
mistake, and could not be jeered at by the crew.
</p>

<p>
The clipper's deck became filled with people
watching the first appearance of their future home,
and the bluish tint soon assumed a green colour.
</p>

<p>
Headlands and indentations became distinct.
Towards a spacious bay, partly protected by an island,
the ship steered, and as she entered it all the upper
canvas was lowered and clewed up.
</p>

<p>
The courses were hauled up, and the topsails came
down on the lower caps.
</p>

<p>
'Let go the anchor!' the captain cried.
</p>

<p>
'Stand clear the chain!' the mate sang out.
</p>

<p>
The blow of a maul on the cat-head was followed
by the roar of the cable through the hawse-pipe.
Then, after a good passage of eighty-five days from
Stonewell, the 'Silver Crown' swung head to wind in
Moreton Bay, Queensland, Australia.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap06"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VI
<br /><br />
SOME NEW EXPERIENCES
</h3>

<p>
'All hands stow canvas!' Mr. Sennit sang out.
</p>

<p>
With a young ordinary seaman Jack helped
to furl the fore royal.  And, that being neatly
accomplished, he then slid down to the topgallant
yard, where two extra men had already arrived.  But
instead of remaining near the mast he was sent out
to the yardarm, where, of course, the work was much
lighter than at the 'bunt,' or centre part of the
sail.
</p>

<p>
The upper and lower topsails were also stowed,
and then the whole port watch 'lay down' to the
fore yard, Jack being still shifted outside of the men.
With a cheery&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Yoh, ho, we'll all sling duff at the cook,'<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
the big sail was rolled up snugly on the yard, and
the men were soon on deck.
</p>

<p>
With the furling of all the canvas the yards were
correctly squared in their lifts and braces, the ropes
were coiled on the belaying-pins, and a general
'knock off of work' followed the safe completion of
the voyage.
</p>

<p>
Jack's attention was immediately directed toward
the appearance of the country in which he had just
arrived, and many emigrants also peered landward.
</p>

<p>
Moreton Bay was of considerable size, deep water
and good anchorage being readily found anywhere,
but of signs of habitations not a trace existed, and
many people openly discussed the means of existence
in such an apparently desolate spot.
</p>

<p>
The land all round seemed of a uniform flatness,
and thickly covered with trees and undergrowth,
while of the River Brisbane, or the city of that name
beside which it was supposed to flow, not the
slightest sign was visible.
</p>

<p>
But it was not long before black smoke was seen
rising above the 'bush' some distance beyond the
inner end of the bay, while out of the foliage there
a small steamer suddenly emerged, and speedily
made fast alongside the clipper.
</p>

<p>
She had brought down a quantity of fresh provisions,
and, in the delight of soon enjoying them, all hands
momentarily forgot about Queensland, or the likelihood
of starvation in an uninhabited country.
</p>

<p>
Jack always believed that the supper of mutton
chops, 'soft tack,' and good tea, partaken of that
night was the sweetest he ever had, and much
chatter went on between the three youngsters in their
room.
</p>

<p>
'I say, Clewlin,' Wilton sang out, 'this is all right,
you know; but do you like the sea?'
</p>

<p>
'Like it?' Jack cried, with mouth full of chop;
'why, there is nothing like it anywhere!'
</p>

<p>
'I hate it,' Wilton returned, 'and mean to give it
up.  It isn't anything so pleasant as I thought.'
</p>

<p>
'What's the matter with it?'
</p>

<p>
'Everything,' Wilton replied.  'First of all, there
are those dreadful night watches&mdash;enough to kill
anyone.'
</p>

<p>
'But you were no worse off than the others,' George
Archer returned.  'Did you think the anchor would
be dropped, and all hands turn in till daylight?'
</p>

<p>
'I certainly never expected that I should have to
haul at the ropes just like the common men, and have
my arms almost dragged out for no earthly reason that
I could see.  It's toil, toil all the time, and no
amusements of any kind.  I tell you I'm sick of the life,
and shall leave it when a favourable chance comes.'
</p>

<p>
'The very best thing you could do,' Archer replied.
</p>

<p>
'And look at the food,' Wilton added; 'salt horse
and pork so fat that only an Icelander would eat it.
Why couldn't they give us something better?'
</p>

<p>
At that point of the discussion Jack was called
aft, and received two letters and several newspapers
directed to himself.
</p>

<p>
As he returned to the room the steamer, laden with
most of the saloon passengers, sheered off, and in her
Captain Thorne also went ashore.
</p>

<p>
Jack was soon eagerly reading his father's long
letters, while an article in a Stonewell paper presently
attracted his notice.
</p>

<p>
'I say, you fellows,' he sang out, 'here is a description
of our departure from Stonewell Harbour.  It's
just splendid.  The writer says that the "Silver
Crown" was the handsomest ship that ever entered
Stonewell Harbour.  Oh, my!  Why, he has put my
name into print.  Just listen, boys!  The only son
of our worthy fellow-townsman, Captain Clewlin, has
had the good fortune to make his first voyage in the
clipper, and to Master Jack we tender our hearty
congratulations and best wishes for his steady
advancement.'
</p>

<p>
The other two boys also received letters from home.
</p>

<p>
'What has become of Sorter?' Jack presently
inquired.  'I haven't seen him since supper.'
</p>

<p>
'He's gone off in the steamer,' Archer whispered.
'Would you believe, boys, that just before he went
he openly boasted to me of having stolen all that
food from our house, and sold it to the people in the
steerage?  He must have been the most disreputable
young scoundrel alive.  He showed me a good deal
of money.  We are well rid of such a character.'
</p>

<p>
'And he told me to tell you, Clewlin,' Charlie
Wilton added, 'that if ever he met you on shore he
would give you a licking.'
</p>

<p>
'I'd like to see him try it,' Jack laughed.  'He
thought that because I wished to keep a promise
to my father, I must be a coward; but he would find
out his mistake.'
</p>

<p>
After dark a lamp was hung on the fore stay;
watchmen patrolled the 'tween deck, and the three
boys were soon enjoying the delights of an 'all
night below.'
</p>

<p>
At six o'clock next morning the crew set to work
washing the deck, and shortly after breakfast the
little steamer returned.
</p>

<p>
She was speedily filled with emigrants, and for
nearly a week the work of disembarkation continued.
</p>

<p>
At last the clipper was cleared of her living
freight.
</p>

<p>
All the sails were sent down from aloft and stowed
away, while the fittings of every cabin in the 'tween
deck and steerage were carefully removed and sent
ashore, and fetched good prices at auction.
</p>

<p>
Then the ship was thoroughly cleaned both inside
and out, and the yards, masts, and hull were painted.
</p>

<p>
Jack Clewlin sent home a full description of his
voyage, and the delights of sea life.  One week later,
during which the 'Merrie England' arrived, he
experienced his first trip on an Australian river.
</p>

<p>
In one of the lifeboats, and accompanied by
Readyman and a strong crew from the starboard
watch, he speedily reached the inner end of the bay
and the mouth of the Brisbane.
</p>

<p>
The twenty miles of somewhat narrow waterway&mdash;the
river being low at the time&mdash;proved peculiarly
fascinating, especially to men long confined on
shipboard, and the winding course of the stream presently
found them wholly land-locked amidst the most
beautiful verdure, that sprang directly from the water,
and grew in such wild luxuriance that not even the
smallest particle of ground could be seen.  Great
tropical plants and large broad-leaved, glass-smooth
fern-palms flourished beneath trees that never shed
their leaves, but from which long strips of bark
depended in fantastic profusion.
</p>

<p>
'It's wonderful pretty, Master Jack,' Readyman
observed.  'The real handiwork of the Creator.  And
yet, I suppose, within a few years it will all have
gone before the axe, and the enterprising advance
of the settler?'
</p>

<p>
'It would be a pity to touch a leaf,' Jack replied.
</p>

<p>
After a long and steady pull up stream the boat
came in sight of the first signs of civilisation.
</p>

<p>
On the left bank of the river a barn-like structure,
which proved to be the general dépôt for all
unmarried women landed from the ships, appeared.
</p>

<p>
On a hill behind it the new settlement of Brisbane
was situated, while close at hand a large square-nosed
ferry-boat, which was hauled to and fro across the
stream by means of a chain cable, gave access to the
opposite and apparently uninhabited bank of the
river.
</p>

<p>
Leaving the lifeboat in charge of the ferry-man
her crew soon reached the summit of the hill.  With
the exception of a few houses clustered round some
Government buildings, a modest church and half a
dozen dwellings standing on commanding positions,
the embryo capital of Queensland appeared to be
chiefly composed of roads and streets marked out for
future occupation.
</p>

<p>
From many of their late emigrant friends the men
received the heartiest welcome, and Jack speedily
discovered that some of the people had already
removed farther up-country, or had taken over
possession of the plots of land apportioned by the
Government to those paying their full passage
money.
</p>

<p>
From the members of a former Stonewell family,
with whom Jack was well acquainted, the lad received
much kindness.  Mr. H&mdash;&mdash; had already purchased
some land on what would presently be the principal
street, and while building operations continued the
family lived in a small bark hut.
</p>

<p>
Through their assistance Readyman was enabled
to secure excellent accommodation for himself and his
young charge, and each found much to interest and
amuse during their brief visit.
</p>

<p>
The older settlers never ceased inquiries about
'the old country,' as England was styled.
</p>

<p>
The most striking spectacle was a small band of
about thirty wretched and dirty-looking 'black
fellows,' or natives of the immense continent, who had
recently arrived at the settlement.  They had brought
with them a solitary British seaman, who for upwards
of twelve years had been wandering all over the
country with the savages, and had, of course, become
well acquainted with the habits and strange customs
of his aboriginal companions.  The man appeared
in fairly good condition, but had almost forgotten
his mother-tongue, and even such words as he still
remembered were uttered in such a guttural manner
as to be almost unrecognisable.
</p>

<p>
It appeared that while attempting the passage of
Torres Strait his vessel had been wrecked, and out
of a full company of twenty hands he alone had
survived.
</p>

<p>
Neither he nor the natives could explain what had
become of the others; but those competent to form
an opinion believed that they had been speared and
eaten by the cannibals.
</p>

<p>
Jack enjoyed a splendid night's rest, the first he
had had between white linen sheets since leaving
home, and after breakfast next morning the 'liberty'
men prepared to return to their ship.  The stream
was now in their favour, and the 'Silver Crown' was
reached in less than half the time occupied on the
upward journey.
</p>

<p>
Charlie Wilton and the remaining half of the
starboard watch next went ashore.  From what he
had already said, Jack was not surprised to find that
Charlie did not return, and he was not again seen.
Of the four apprentices who had left Stonewell, two,
Archer and Clewlin, alone remained, and even they
were soon parted.
</p>

<p>
The clipper received orders to proceed to Bombay
for a homeward freight of cotton.  All the canvas
was immediately 'bent,' and tacks, sheets, bunt-lines,
and reef-tackles were rove off.
</p>

<p>
When those sailing preparations were completed
a wholly unexpected turn of affairs suddenly placed
young Jack in considerable difficulty, and occasioned
him much anxiety.
</p>

<p>
Captain Thorne had been medically advised not to
visit India, since, only two voyages before, he had
contracted a dangerous illness at Bombay.
</p>

<p>
After long deliberation with his two officers, all
three men had agreed to exchange places with the
master and mates of a smaller vessel, belonging to
the same firm, then in the bay.
</p>

<p>
She was only half the size of the clipper, and had
come out with cargo, but she was nearly ready to sail
for Newcastle, N.S.W., there to load coal for Java.
</p>

<p>
At last Jack decided to consult his old friend
Readyman.
</p>

<p>
'I want to follow Captain Thorne,' he said.
</p>

<p>
'Well, my son,' the quarter-master replied, 'I
certainly believe you are on the right tack.  The
skipper you know is better than the one you've had
no dealings with.  Putting that aside, sonny, you'd
have a far better chance of learning your business in a
small craft.  In this clipper there are men enough to
turn her inside out, so to say, and youngsters must
stand aside, or teach themselves as best they may.
You've had three months' experience, and can see
that no one here takes much notice of others.
Barring what I've tried to do, lad, there isn't
another man to show you how to splice a rope-yarn.
I believe your father spoke to Thorne, and he would
naturally feel more interested than any stranger.  Yes,
lad, I should try to palaver the old man as soon as
may be, and if you go I'll not be far astern.'
</p>

<p>
'Humph!' the captain grunted, on hearing Jack's
tale.  'I do not see why you should leave so fine a
vessel for one not half her size.  But if you would
really sooner come with me there is nothing to keep
you away, only you must clearly understand, boy,
that in a craft of that kind there are few hands, and
you will have to take an ordinary seaman's place, and
work as he would.'
</p>

<p>
'I don't mind that, sir,' Jack promptly replied.  'I
wish to learn all I can before returning home.'
</p>

<p>
'Very good.  Can you box the compass?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, sir, and knot and splice ropes, too,' Jack
proudly said.
</p>

<p>
'Who taught you?'
</p>

<p>
'Readyman, sir; he knew and sailed with my
father.'
</p>

<p>
'Get your gear shifted immediately.  I told your
father I'd make either a lubber or a sailor of his boy.'
</p>

<p>
Jack needed no further incentive.  'I say, Archer,'
he cried, on entering the deck-house, 'I'm off to the
new vessel.  Are you coming?'
</p>

<p>
'What!  Into a cockle-shell like her?  Not likely.'
</p>

<p>
Jack soon joined the new craft, which was a barque
of nine hundred tons, named the 'Alert,' and into her
Readyman also exchanged; but Archer, the elder
apprentice, remained on the clipper.
</p>

<p>
For a few days Jack found himself cramped for
'elbow-room,' but his new quarters were far superior
to those lately occupied, since he now lived aft in the
fore cabin with the two officers and the steward.
</p>

<p>
A week later both vessels left Moreton Bay
together, but although the 'Alert' was by no means
a slow craft she could not keep pace with her larger
consort, which raced away at great speed and soon
disappeared.  And that was the last Jack Clewlin
ever saw of her.
</p>

<p>
Without noteworthy incident the barque arrived
safely at Newcastle, which is situated near the mouth
of the Hunter River, New South Wales, some sixty
miles from Sydney.  There she immediately
proceeded to load coal for Batavia.
</p>

<p>
So busily employed were all hands that little
opportunity for visiting the town was afforded.  Some
of the crew received a sound 'ducking' while attempting
to walk the stout spars that kept the vessel clear
of the river bank, so Jack wisely decided to remain
on board.
</p>

<p>
The hold being filled, and the coal dust washed
away, the sails were sent aloft and 'bent,' or fastened
to the yards; at that work Jack took his place, his
light weight being most suitable for the royal yards,
while Readyman had shown him how the canvas
should be secured.  Indeed, what with his knowledge
of splicing and knotting the ropes, and other valuable
information imparted by his old friend, the mates
soon perceived his eagerness to learn, and afforded
him much more opportunity of speedy advance than
would ever have occurred on the clipper.
</p>

<p>
Accompanied by a large brig and a full-rigged
ship, the 'Alert' put to sea, all three vessels being
bound to Java.
</p>

<p>
The 'Alert' soon made a good offing, and to Jack's
extreme satisfaction Captain Thorne ordered him to
relieve the helmsman, whose greater strength was
needed to cat-head and secure the anchor.  Under
the watchful eye of the master himself, the young
helmsman attained such proficiency in the art of
steering, that when one of the crew presently fell ill
the lad was able to take his place.
</p>

<p>
Of that advance no one felt prouder than Readyman.
'It's all through learning the compass, lad,' he said.
'You've moved into the best vessel to learn your
business, and the old man means that you shall.'
</p>

<p>
'The mate says we are going through Torres Strait,'
Jack said.
</p>

<p>
'A mighty rough spot, Master Jack,' Readyman
replied.  'I've never been there, but a mate of mine
once sailed that way, and was no more seen.  It's full
of coral reefs and islands, and some cannibals, I'm
told, and woe betide the craft that runs ashore.'
</p>

<p>
'I hope we shall have better luck,' Jack returned.
</p>

<p>
That afternoon some signalling passed between the
'Alert' and the brig which had come out with her
from the river, and it was then arranged that both
should keep together while passing through Torres
Strait, the ninety miles wide channel lying between
Cape York in Australia and the shores of New
Guinea.
</p>

<p>
Of the ship they took no notice, partly because she
was a German, and partly owing to her keeping a
more off-shore course.
</p>

<p>
The weather continued delightful, and for many
days the two vessels sailed along the mainland, passed
Moreton Bay, and the new settlement farther north
known as Rockhampton.  At last they were abreast
of the southern end of that wonderful marine formation
named the Great Barrier Reef, which, an almost
unbroken line of coral, extends southward from Cape
York for a distance of fourteen hundred miles.
</p>

<p>
This remarkable structure varies considerably in its
distance from the mainland.  At places toward the
north it is not more than ten or twelve miles off,
but farther south, and especially toward its end, it is
as much as one hundred miles away, while the
channel between it and the shore can be navigated
with ease.  Its seaward face rises almost
perpendicularly from the ocean, and in some places narrow
passages admit small craft.
</p>

<p>
For Jack Clewlin the new life on which he had
ventured was daily becoming more and more interesting,
and he and Readyman never regretted the
change.
</p>

<p>
Day by day both vessels kept well together, the brig
sometimes forging far ahead in the light winds, while
on other occasions the barque easily passed her in
strong breezes.  At last they reached the northern
end of the Great Reef, it and the main coast being
visible; and, having left some islands astern, the
entrance of the dreaded strait was found.
</p>

<p>
The utmost vigilance was now maintained.  To the
vast delight of all hands, a splendid fair wind began
to freshen, just as the dawn of a beautiful morning
showed eastward.
</p>

<p>
The captain came on deck, in hope of running
through the most dangerous portion of the
coral-obstructed waterway before dark.  Every inch of
canvas was immediately set, and to assist the lookout
at the bow Jack Clewlin was sent to the masthead.
</p>

<p>
Until then he had had little experience of coral
reefs, but would now speedily find himself well-nigh
beset by them.  Yet in point of danger those awash,
and consequently visible, were as nothing in
comparison with others hidden a few feet beneath the
surface, and steadily pushed upward by their minute
builders.
</p>

<p>
He had just made himself comfortable on the
fore topgallant-yard, when, far ahead and slightly off
the port bow, a small black object, with the faint but
curious tracery of what looked like the masts and
rigging of a vessel, appeared.
</p>

<p>
As no canvas could be seen, Jack naturally
concluded that she was at anchor, and he immediately
reported the discovery.
</p>

<p>
'Ay, ay,' Mr. Statten sang out.  'How far off?'
</p>

<p>
'About ten miles, sir,' Jack replied.
</p>

<p>
The officer was soon beside him in the crosstrees,
and through his glasses peered at the stranger.
Then he began to laugh.
</p>

<p>
'Oh yes, she's "anchored," sure enough, and likely
to remain there a spell,' he said.  'It's the big
German, Clewlin, hard and fast on a reef.  She
has evidently been trying to make a fast passage,
and come to grief in the dark.'
</p>

<p>
'Is there anyone on board, sir?'
</p>

<p>
'I cannot tell just yet.  Anyhow, her colours are
at the gaff-end, but she lies very badly.'
</p>

<p>
Telling Jack to remain where he was, the mate
hastened on deck, and signalling the brig, which was
farther astern, the 'Alert' bore down to make
inquiry.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VII
<br /><br />
THE DANGERS OF TORRES STRAIT
</h3>

<p>
'Fore crosstrees, there!  Stand by to
stow the royal.'
</p>

<p>
'Ay, ay, sir,' Jack sang out.
</p>

<p>
Within a few minutes the starboard studding-sails
fluttered to the deck, and the topgallant sails and
royals were clewed up, while coming up astern the
brig also shortened sail, and cautiously approaching
the wreck both vessels hove-to half a mile to windward.
</p>

<p>
The big German ship was abandoned, and must
have been ashore several days.
</p>

<p>
However, having furled the fore royal Jack turned
his attention toward the busy scene passing on the
deck below, and keenly regretted that duty prevented
a personal visit to the wreck.  The hands were
clearing away one of the boats, which was on the
point of being lowered, when Captain Thorne himself
hailed the masthead.  'Lay down from aloft,' he
sang out.  'Look sharp!'
</p>

<p>
Jack seized the back-stay and slid to the deck,
where, to his delight, he was ordered to join the boat,
and immediately sat beside Mr. Statten.
</p>

<p>
A strong pull soon took them close to the wreck,
which lay on a submerged reef some two fathoms
below the surface, her decks sharply inclined at an
angle of about fifty degrees, and the masts and yards
still standing thrust out far beyond the hull, over
which waves occasionally broke in jets of spray.
</p>

<p>
On closer approach Jack perceived that the entire
surface of the reef was covered with coal, which had
fallen through great holes in the lee-bilge of the
vessel.  On passing to leeward round her stern
numerous casks of salted provisions and other
floatable gear were drifting away before the wind.
She was indeed a pitiable spectacle.
</p>

<p>
On getting alongside the mizen chains, the
puzzling difficulty of how to reach her saloon
immediately arose, for the deck stood like a huge wall, up
which not even a sailor could climb, and Mr. Statten
had been directed to search the cabin for any document
likely to indicate what had become of the missing
crew.
</p>

<p>
'I think I could reach it, sir!' Jack eagerly
exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
'Well, bear a hand,' the mate replied.  'Those
drifting casks are valuable, and might be saved.'
</p>

<p>
Seizing a favourable opportunity Jack sprang into
the lee rigging, and nimbly climbing up its inner side
presently succeeded in reaching the mizen top,
crossed to windward, and with a wave of his cap to the
'Alert' he promptly descended the weather shrouds,
and sliding down the steep deck reached the saloon
skylight.
</p>

<p>
A few moments later he had swung himself into
the cabin below, where nothing seemed disturbed.
Nailed to the table was a piece of paper, which in
good English stated that the whole crew had decided
to attempt the passage of the strait in their boats,
and if possible reach Turtle Island, at the opposite
end, where it was known that British war-vessels
frequently left provisions for those in distress.  With
that information Jack promptly returned to his
companions.
</p>

<p>
'A mighty risky procedure,' Mr. Statten exclaimed,
on perusal of the document.  'Suppose they are
becalmed near any of the islands, and are seen by the
savages?  Those, however, might be passed during
the night, and the boats could easily clear sunken
reefs which larger vessels would strike.'
</p>

<p>
The boat pushed off, and Captain Thorne was
informed of the note.
</p>

<p>
'We might save a lot of good gear, sir,' the mate
added.
</p>

<p>
'No, no,' the old man replied.  'Our lives are
much more important.  I shan't lose a good wind
for such rubbish.  Hook on the boat-falls.'
</p>

<p>
So the boat was hoisted 'two blocks' in the davits,
and again setting every inch of canvas that would
draw, and quickly followed by the brig, away sped
the barque, in a brave attempt to pass the most
dangerous portion of the strait during daylight.
</p>

<p>
The decks being cleared up Jack enjoyed a
substantial breakfast, and was then supplied with a
quantity of biscuit for use during the day.
Accompanied by Mr. Statten he returned to his former
position at the masthead, with strict orders to keep
watch and report all reefs in sight.
</p>

<p>
The position afforded an extensive range of vision,
and it was not long before several streaks of white
water under the port bow indicated coral just awash,
while others were visible on the starboard beam.
Between them, however, and as far as could be seen,
the deep blue fairway remained unbroken; but when
Jack 'shinned' up to the topgallant yard, he immediately
perceived and reported the loom of land ahead.
</p>

<p>
'That's Thursday Island,' the mate replied.  'Keep
close lookout for another, named Prince of Wales.'
</p>

<p>
Under her big press of sail the' Alert' raced along
in grand style, but the brig was slowly dropping
astern.
</p>

<p>
However, as plenty of good daylight would remain
for several hours, not much notice was taken of her,
and Jack became keenly interested in the beautiful
scene spread out before him.  Thursday Island was
fast losing its cloud-like appearance, every portion of
it being covered with trees and scrub, but no sign of
habitation or natives was apparent.
</p>

<p>
The canvas of the barque swelled out splendidly
in the fresh fair wind, mounds of foam rolled away
from beneath the bow, while over all was an unclouded
sky of brilliant blue.
</p>

<p>
Prince of Wales Island also hove in sight, and
when the barque was nearly abreast of it Jack saw a
white signal being energetically waved by someone
ashore, and he immediately warned his companion.
</p>

<p>
'It might be a sign from the missing crew,'
Mr. Statten said.  He hailed the deck.
</p>

<p>
Captain Thorne promptly altered his course and
stood in nearer to the island, where three white
specks that lay up on a yellow beach proved to be
European-built boats.
</p>

<p>
The barque's crew became excited respecting the
fate of the Germans, since only the bearer of the
signal could be seen.  Suddenly the report of sharp
musketry firing from behind some thick scrub was
heard.
</p>

<p>
Almost immediately several men were seen slowly
retreating towards the boats.  They were followed
by many naked savages, hurling long spears and
short pieces of bent wood.
</p>

<p>
'The whites are fighting for their lives!' Captain
Thorne sang out.  'We must save them.'
</p>

<p>
The islanders were striving to surround their
victims, and the firing almost ceased, as if the
ammunition were failing.
</p>

<p>
The crisp, short orders of the captain rang fore
and aft.  'Port watch for'a'd, starboard watch aft,'
he cried.  'In with the stu'n's'ls, sir.  Clear away
the anchor and chain.  Bear a hand, now.  Lead-line
into the main chains.  Let fly all royal and topgallant
halyards.  Have both quarter-boats ready for
lowering.  Fore crosstrees, there!  Lay down from
aloft!  Stand by the braces, men.'
</p>

<p>
Mr. Sennit hastened forward, and soon had the
anchor and cable ready to let go, the studding-sails
came down smartly, the royal and topgallant
halyards were let fly, and under easy canvas
the 'Alert' drew nearer shore.
</p>

<p>
All that while the Germans near the beach&mdash;for
they proved to be the missing crew&mdash;were making
desperate exertions to reach the boats, and having
exhausted nearly all their cartridges, took to hurling
stones, or anything they could find, at the yelling
savages, who still maintained a stubborn front, and
caused several casualties by spear and club.
</p>

<p>
'What water have you now?' the captain cried.
</p>

<p>
'A quarter less five!' the leadsman sang out.
</p>

<p>
'Let go the anchor for'a'd!'
</p>

<p>
Through the hawse-pipe coil after coil of cable
flew, and the barque swung head to wind.  Before
she had lost all way, both boats were lowered,
manned by strong armed crews, and, braving all
subsequent rebuke, Jack Clewlin promptly took a
seat beside the second mate.
</p>

<p>
'You should not have come, boy,' the latter said.
</p>

<p>
'I can mind the boat, sir,' Jack returned.
</p>

<p>
<a id="p80"></a>
With right goodwill the men lay back on their
oars, and cheers greeted the almost surrounded
Germans.  Directly the boats struck the beach all
hands jumped ashore, and immediately arranged
themselves into watches under the respective leaders.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Sennit dashed toward the right wing of the
foe, and with his men the second mate rushed
toward the opposite extremity, both parties firing
as rapidly as their weapons could be reloaded.  The
yelling cannibals speedily wavered, and sought cover
among the adjacent scrub and trees.  But the
Germans were still vigorously assailed by a centre
knot of the foe, whereupon both British watches
united, and pouring in an almost continuous volley
of lead speedily relieved the situation.  The savages
suddenly retreated, but not before they had carried
off the whole of their dead and wounded.
</p>

<p>
So closely had Jack Clewlin followed the fortunes
of his friends on shore that the approach of further
assistance was not noticed.  For the brig, on seeing
her consort shorten sail and bear up for the island,
immediately followed, and sent men to the rescue.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps it was their timely arrival which ended
the fray.  At anyrate, the savages were not again
seen, but several of their spears were secured as
trophies of the struggle.
</p>

<p>
On hasty examination it was discovered that the
Germans had suffered serious loss.  Four of them
were found dead among the scrub, while six others
had been more or less severely wounded.  What the
uninjured had dreaded more than the spears were
the short pieces of bent and blackened wood, known
as 'boomerangs,' for when those were thrown with
force the result was astonishing.  They could easily
kill any small animal or bird without losing
momentum, and would return to the point of
discharge.  Two of the men had been killed by
them, but in those cases the weapons lost further
power on striking such heavy obstacles.
</p>

<p>
A recall signal on the 'Alert' attracted attention.
</p>

<p>
'All aboard!' Mr. Sennit sang out.  'We can do
no more, and must not lose the fair wind.'
</p>

<p>
The boats on the beach were refloated.  The
wounded and dead were placed in them, and all
hands proceeded to rejoin their vessels, not one of
the rescuers having been injured.
</p>

<p>
The anchors of both vessels were promptly
cat-headed.  The German boats were sunk, and
the dead were buried at sea, so that they should
not fall into the hands of the cannibals.
</p>

<p>
The cause of all the trouble was not far to seek.
The wrecked crew, finding their supply of water
running short, and unaware of the savage character
of the islanders, had gone ashore to fill their casks,
with the result described.
</p>

<p>
On reaching the 'Alert' Jack Clewlin expected
nothing less than a severe reprimand from his
captain.  Of such, however, there was no sign,
and the lad felt relieved.  On the other hand,
Readyman expressed strong approval of his conduct.
</p>

<p>
'You did quite right, my son,' he said.  'Act so,
and never hang back from any duty.  Make it a
firm resolve always to be on the spot, or at the
yardarm, when required, and even should you not
know exactly how the work ought to be done, you
will mostly find a good man alongside to show you.'
</p>

<p>
'I hope the captain is not angry,' Jack observed.
</p>

<p>
'Not he, lad.  You needn't trouble about that.
When you go wrong, he'll pretty soon pull you up
all astanding.'
</p>

<p>
'The natives lost a number of men, Readyman;
I saw several of them fall at the edge of the bush.'
</p>

<p>
'Sarve them right, Master Jack.  They will know
better next time.  They couldn't have seen our
vessels coming along, and so thought they had the
game to themselves.'
</p>

<p>
Accompanied by the second mate, Jack presently
regained his old place at the fore topmast head, and
shortly after clearing the island he perceived a
milky-hued patch of water right ahead.
</p>

<p>
'A submerged and uncharted reef!' Mr. Statten
exclaimed.  Through his glasses he peered at the
obstacle, and then perceiving how the deep blue
channel should be followed, gave the true course
to the captain from a small compass which he
carried.
</p>

<p>
'Steady at that, sir,' he sang out, as the barque
swung away on her new course.  'All clear ahead.
No more off.'
</p>

<p>
The 'Alert' raced along in grand style, and as
there were no more reefs to trouble them Jack and
his companion enjoyed a good meal of biscuit and
salt pork.
</p>

<p>
Away astern the brig was hard pressed to hold
her own, and the islands speedily disappeared.  The
barque was soon abreast of the sea-covered reef,
which looked to be about three fathoms below the
surface, and she passed so close along one side that
the line of deep and shallow water was distinctly
defined, the whole structure appearing like a huge
white wall rising in the blue water.
</p>

<p>
'And every portion of it is built by minute insects,'
Mr. Statten observed.  'Year after year the work
proceeds without cessation, till, on contact with the
air, the builders die.  Then drifting débris lodges
and rots in the crevices, birds resting there drop
seeds, which take root and flourish, and in that
way most of the Pacific islands were formed.'
</p>

<p>
'And that reef will be one some day,' Jack replied.
</p>

<p>
'Yes, and probably inhabited by such savages as
we fought just now,' the mate added.  'They quarrel
among themselves, and the weakest goes to some
new place.'
</p>

<p>
'Look, sir,' Jack cried, and pointed ahead, 'there
are more reefs just awash.'
</p>

<p>
Mr. Statten peered through his glasses.  'Why,'
he said, 'we seem to be sailing into a nest of them.
Shin up to the topgallant-yard, and tell me where the
channel lies.'
</p>

<p>
Jack was soon seated on his old perch, and thus
elevated, could see for several miles past the
obstructions.  A good clear 'lead' through them was also
visible, and as the vessel still decreased her distance,
the foaming ridges seemed to widen out considerably,
so that what at first appeared a particularly dangerous
channel presently proved to be quite safe, and
through it the 'Alert' passed without the slightest
difficulty.
</p>

<p>
'The brig will have to hurry up,' Mr. Statten said.
'The afternoon is slipping away, and she's a long
way astern.'
</p>

<p>
'But the moon's at the full, sir,' Jack observed.
</p>

<p>
'Why, you're becoming a regular old shellback,'
the mate laughed.  'I expect it's bred in the
bone.'
</p>

<p>
'That is what my father said when I wished to go
to sea,' Jack exclaimed.  'What does it mean?'
</p>

<p>
'That you are a sailor born and bred, and the son
of one.'
</p>

<p>
They remained aloft throughout the afternoon,
while the captain kept close watch on the steering,
and just after sundown a small island appeared off
the starboard bow.
</p>

<p>
'We are safe now,' the captain sang out.  'One
hundred and ten miles since daylight.  It's first-rate.
Lay down from aloft.'
</p>

<p>
Jack and the mate enjoyed a good supper that
night, and the barque was hove-to till daylight, so as
to discover what had happened to the brig.
</p>

<p>
The night passed uneventfully.  In the grey of
coming dawn the brig was seen making desperate
endeavour to overhaul her companion, and presently
reported an almost miraculous escape from destruction
while sailing through the last series of reefs.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII
<br /><br />
IN THE JAVA SEA
</h3>

<p>
The 'Alert,' with studding-sails and all square
canvas set, soon passed the brig, and throughout
the following day only a few reefs, and
those at considerable distances, were seen.  The
weather remained beautifully fine, but the wind fell so
light that the smaller vessel, drawing much less water,
soon forged ahead and disappeared.  They were
now drawing well away from the dangerous strait,
and, with a clear course, shaped directly for
Batavia.
</p>

<p>
Every day Jack Clewlin felt increasing pleasure
from his exchange of ships; and the wider scope for
acquiring knowledge of his profession also added to
that feeling.  Beside that, Readyman had by no
means dropped his voluntary advice and tutorship,
and many an evening dog-watch was still usefully
passed.
</p>

<p>
'I wish you would borrow the hand lead-line from
Mr. Statten,' he once observed.  'I could show you
how to use it.'
</p>

<p>
Jack immediately obtained the line, and another
lesson began.
</p>

<p>
'Of course,' the quarter-master continued, 'you
already know that on board ship everything is
measured in feet and fathoms, and that a fathom
is six feet, or two yards in length.  Every vessel
carries one hand and one deep-sea lead-line.  The
shorter and lighter one is only used in shallow water.
Now then, lad, listen to me.  At two fathoms, you
see, there is a bit of leather; at three fathoms the
mark is the same, but the leather tag is split; at
five fathoms the mark is white rag; at seven fathoms
there is a red one; at ten fathoms it is a piece of
leather with a hole in it; at fifteen fathoms it is a
blue rag; at seventeen, it is the same as at seven, and
at twenty fathoms there is a bit of cord with two
knots in it.'
</p>

<p>
'How is the hand line used?' Jack inquired.
</p>

<p>
'You stand in the main chains, grip the line about
six feet from the sinker, swing it over your head, and
let it fly as far for'a'd as possible.  The deep-sea lead
is too heavy for that, so it is carried to the forecastle-head,
while the line is passed outside of everything to
windward, and, when fastened to the sinker, is thrown
overboard.'
</p>

<p>
'I never thought there was so much to learn about
ships.'
</p>

<p>
'Much!' Readyman exclaimed, 'why, sonny, you
don't know anything yet.  What about the cutting
and the fitting of rigging, masting and dismasting,
stowage of cargoes, and a hundred other matters?
It will need your four years' apprenticeship to know
but a little; and as an officer you must be a good
navigator.  Ay, Master Jack, and talking like that
reminds me that you should learn sail-making.  It
comes in very handy to use a palm.'
</p>

<p>
He produced a small band of leather, in the centre
of which the head of a strong sewing thimble
appeared, with some canvas and twine.  'There you are,'
he said.  'Put the palm on your right hand, and push
the needle through the cloth.  You could not do that
with your fingers.'
</p>

<p>
Jack set to work forming correct stitches, and soon
made good progress, and in that way many pleasant
hours were passed.  Neither of the friends forgot their
Bible-classes, while, now that everyone had settled
down in their places, Captain Thorne himself read
prayers each Sunday in the cabin.
</p>

<p>
One morning, shortly before reaching Batavia, the
watch on deck witnessed a most remarkable and
interesting spectacle.  At four o'clock Mr. Statten and
the starboard watch relieved the deck.  Even at that
early hour it was almost broad daylight, its exquisite
softness and purity being noticeably striking.  Save
a number of small puff-like clouds ranged along the
western horizon nothing was visible.  Just after five
o'clock, however, the lookout reported an island slowly
rising off the starboard bow.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Statten expressed considerable surprise, and
immediately ran forward.
</p>

<p>
By that time the object had become much more
distinct, and seemed to be thickly covered with trees
from its triangular summit down to the water's edge.
But the most perplexing fact was, that although the
barque was not moving faster than three knots an hour,
the island approached at four times that rate.
</p>

<p>
'I cannot understand how it can be so near,' the
mate said.  'There is nothing marked on the chart
within forty miles of us.'
</p>

<p>
'And five minutes ago, sir, there wasn't the least
trace of it,' a sailor replied.
</p>

<p>
'Run aft and call the captain, Jack,' Mr. Statten
said.
</p>

<p>
'Island!' the old man sang out from his room.
'You and the mate must be asleep and dreaming.'
</p>

<p>
'It is quite distinct, and about twelve miles off, sir,'
Jack replied.
</p>

<p>
The skipper was astonished on perceiving the island,
while, to the still greater surprise of all spectators, it
suddenly vanished as mysteriously as it had appeared.
</p>

<p>
'A mirage!' the captain laughingly exclaimed.  'At
anyrate, it was the most remarkable I've ever seen.
All others were inverted on the clouds, but that one
looked perfectly natural.  At first I believed my
reckoning, or the chronometer, was wrong.  The
longer one lives the more one learns.'
</p>

<p>
Without further incident the 'Alert' arrived at
Batavia.  There the brig, which had forged far ahead
in the light winds, was already discharging her cargo
in the roadstead.
</p>

<p>
The rescued German crew was immediately sent
ashore, and some of them went to hospital to have
their spear wounds dressed.
</p>

<p>
The 'Alert' immediately prepared to discharge her
coals, and during several weeks Jack Clewlin
experienced the most arduous toil of his life.  From early
morning till darkness set in he took his place at the
winch, by which the cargo was raised from the hold,
or used a shovel down below as stoutly as anyone on
board.
</p>

<p>
'I like it,' he said to his old friend.  'It doesn't
need rocking to put me to sleep at night.'
</p>

<p>
Captain Thorne and the mates kept watchful eyes
on him, but when the work was done, and he was not
allowed to visit the capital with any of the men, the
disappointed lad became thoroughly disheartened and
suspicious.  Was the skipper punishing him for having
left the barque without permission when she touched
at the island in Torres Strait?  He failed to perceive
any other cause for such apparent neglect, and would
have preferred a summary 'drum-head' court-martial
to thus remaining neglected by those whom he had
always endeavoured to serve faithfully.  One morning
he was called aft.
</p>

<p>
'Put up a shirt, collars, and a tooth-brush,' the
skipper said.
</p>

<p>
'Am I to put on my best gear, sir,' Jack inquired.
</p>

<p>
'Why, of course,' the captain said.  'You're going
ashore.'
</p>

<p>
In 'spick-and-span' trim Jack presently stood beside
the gangway; but, truth to say, his brass-buttoned
uniform was fast becoming too small for its owner,
who had now been nearly twelve months at sea, and
was fast filling out in breadth of shoulder and length
of limb.
</p>

<p>
The captain's 'clew-to-earing' glance, as sailors
say, proved satisfactory, and tumbling over the side
with his small bundle Jack presently found himself
passing along a narrow canal, beloved of the Dutch
who govern the island.
</p>

<p>
In the early part of the sixteenth century the
Portuguese discovered the country, and some seventy
years later it was occupied by the Dutch, after
considerable opposition.  Later on they were driven out
by the French, who, in their turn, surrendered to
the English, and the latter finally exchanged the
possession with the Hollanders for other islands in
those seas.
</p>

<p>
The Island of Java is six hundred miles long, by
from twenty to forty-five miles wide, and is considered
the 'Paradise of the East.'  Batavia, the capital, was
built by the Dutch not far from Sunda Strait, which
lies between it and the opposite coast of Sumatra.
</p>

<p>
The climate generally is healthy, if somewhat
oppressive for Europeans; but the elevated country
of the interior enjoys a cool temperature, and there
most of the officials reside.  The soil is extraordinarily
fertile, and all the fruits and commercial exports
indigenous to the Far East are freely raised.  The
natives are highly intelligent, friendly, and
gentle-mannered, but they were not permitted to acquire the
Dutch language, and were compelled to sell their
produce at fixed rates to their masters.  Competition
with outsiders was rigorously prohibited.  Strangers
might procure passports when visiting the country,
yet their presence was not sought, nor by any
means desired.
</p>

<p>
Captain Thorne and his young companion presently
reached the principal hotel, and there Jack was
temporarily left to study the manners and customs
of the people.
</p>

<p>
The houses were not lofty, but that was owing to
the fear of sudden collapse, since the whole of Java is
peculiarly subject to violent volcanic disturbances.
Many Europeans appeared about the town, and their
strange and decidedly 'airy' attire during the first
part of each day much astonished young Jack.  The
gentlemen strolled about in straw hats, pyjamas, and
grass slippers, while the ladies appeared, even in the
streets, without stockings, and wearing only a light
kind of blouse, with a light dress of native material
and simple design.
</p>

<p>
'I am glad they are all foreigners,' Jack mused.  'I
cannot recognise an English face among the crowd.'
</p>

<p>
At noon the customary 'rice-table' was announced,
and beside Captain Thorne Jack took his place.
Each of the guests was supplied with a large
soup-plate containing a quantity of cooked rice.  From
dishes handed round by servants, portions of fish,
fowl, meat, and several kinds of vegetables, were
selected and placed on the rice.  Over all curry,
chutney, and other condiments were poured, the
combination being then well mixed and consumed.
</p>

<p>
To the watchful and imitative youngster such a
meal seemed more than sufficient; but when a second
course of roast meat, vegetables, and quantities of
delicious fruit were washed down by excellent coffee,
he concluded that Dutch men and women were
blessed with enormous appetites.  He was not greatly
surprised to find that all of them soon retired to
enjoy a nap; but Captain Thorne hastened off to visit
his agent.
</p>

<p>
Jack strolled out to see something of the capital,
which stood on low ground, and he found a barrack
filled with European troops.  The soldiers greeted
him cheerily, but not being able to speak their
language all efforts to make themselves understood
failed.  The natives were all of a light-brown
complexion, and although small and slight of build
their movements were graceful.
</p>

<p>
At five o'clock that evening Captain Thorne
returned to the hotel, and Jack could scarcely believe
that the stylishly-dressed people beginning to appear
were those whom he had seen in such careless, if
comfortable, attire earlier in the day.  But such was
the fact.  All of them were decked out in the latest
home fashion, and having finished their coffee they
all drove out to enjoy the cool evening breeze, or
leave cards on friends.
</p>

<p>
At nine o'clock dinner was served.  At its conclusion
Jack believed that his short spell of 'liberty'
had ended.
</p>

<p>
'Fetch your gear, Clewlin,' the old man said.
'Bear a hand.'
</p>

<p>
On returning to the vestibule he found a Java car
and three ponies standing before the door.
</p>

<p>
'Come here, boy,' the skipper exclaimed, and then,
turning toward a friend, added, 'This is the lad I
spoke of, Sergeant.  Do you see any resemblance?'
</p>

<p>
The gentleman thus addressed took Jack's hand,
and by the strong light from the hotel peered in his
face.
</p>

<p>
'Yes, very considerable,' he replied.  'I am glad
to make your acquaintance, Jack,' he continued.  'Of
course, you do not know me.  Well, my son, years
ago I sailed in a barque as her supercargo, and your
father was her first mate.  I only escaped drowning
by the merest accident.  I left her the voyage before
she was lost in the China Sea.'
</p>

<p>
'Was that the "Isabella," sir?' Jack inquired.
</p>

<p>
'Yes,' replied Mr. Sergeant, who was the barque's
agent.  'Did your father tell you about it?'
</p>

<p>
'No, sir; but there is a man on the "Alert" whom
he saved at that time.'
</p>

<p>
'Indeed!  What is his name?'
</p>

<p>
'Readyman.  He told me all about the wreck.'
</p>

<p>
'And that is why you two have always been such
friends,' Captain Thorne laughed.  'He is a good and
steady man.'
</p>

<p>
'Well, Jack,' Mr. Sergeant continued, 'I am taking
the captain and you for a drive up-country.  If you
don't enjoy it, do not put the blame on me.  All
aboard!'
</p>

<p>
They were soon seated in the car.  Mr. Sergeant
took the reins, and away at top speed went the ponies,
each apparently bent on having 'a good time,' as
their master said, and thoroughly enjoying the
beautiful cool breeze.  That drive was long remembered
by the youngest of the party.  The night and
the breeze were delightful.  Numberless stars twinkled
brilliantly, the outlook was wonderfully clear, and
the lights of Batavia soon disappeared.
</p>

<p>
For a while the flat and dusty road proved somewhat
monotonous.  Gradually, however, they began
to ascend to higher levels, and the flat and unhealthy
neighbourhood of Batavia loomed dimly far below
them, till wholly obscured in the night gloom.  The
country soon became more thickly timbered, and
trees lined the well-kept road for considerable
distances.  Myriads of fire-flies flitted about the
foliage, and with the accurate knowledge of the
highway possessed by the driver, rapid progress was
made.  Here and there Mr. Sergeant pointed out
the residences of certain wealthy Dutch planters, and
he also supplied the strangely-sounding names of
villages passed through.
</p>

<p>
Shortly after two o'clock next morning he pulled
up before a house owned by a cheery-faced but
exceedingly rotund little Dutchman, and by him
the party was most kindly welcomed.
</p>

<p>
They had evidently been expected.  Light
refreshment was served, and almost asleep Jack
Clewlin finally tumbled into a home-like bed, and
remembered no more of his first night drive in Java.
</p>

<p>
Shortly after six o'clock he was aroused.  In the
bathroom, which was really a screened-off portion of
an open scullery, he found a small basin of water and
a large wooden spoon awaiting his convenience.
Such a primitive arrangement provoked a laugh, but
the 'sprinkle' was nevertheless enjoyed, and he
speedily joined his friends.  He felt prodigiously
hungry, but presently discovered that nothing like a
solid English breakfast was forthcoming, and that
only a cup of coffee with some fruit was served.  As
a matter of fact, the European residents never partook
of any real meal before the usual twelve o'clock
'rice-table.'
</p>

<p>
With their host the gentlemen visited his sugarcane
and coffee plantations, and there found numbers
of native men and women engaged in light work.
</p>

<p>
The ponies being again ready for the road
Mr. Sergeant took leave of his Dutch friend, and during
the drive he thoughtfully supplied both Captain
Thorne and young Jack with biscuits and lemonade.
'You are not accustomed to our meal hours,' he said.
</p>

<p>
Just before noon they again halted at a neat little
inn kept by a native, and there the 'rice-table' was
again discussed.  The ponies were there exchanged
for others, and during the afternoon much ground
was covered.
</p>

<p>
Ever since leaving Batavia they had been gradually
ascending and getting deeper into the real country.
Immense peaks began to rise round them, and
pointing in a certain direction Mr. Sergeant explained
that not very far distant the finest botanical garden
in the world was situated.
</p>

<p>
'It is at a place called Buitenzorg,' he said, 'and
the governor-general resides there.  The Dutchmen
almost worship the spot, and I really do not blame
them.  Although it is only eight hundred feet above
sea level, the climate is cool and healthy.  Botanists
from all parts of the world visit the gardens, where
you may see candles, and even bread, growing in
profusion.'
</p>

<p>
'And perhaps clothes?' Captain Thorne laughingly
added.
</p>

<p>
'Yes; in the same sense that yours grew on
sheep,' Mr. Sergeant replied.  'The <i>tappa</i> cloth of
the Pacific islanders is made from the inner bark
and fine fibres of certain palms, so I may truly say
that clothes grow there also.  There is a famous
avenue of trees there, and thousands of blossoms
growing on the trunks instead of on the branches of
different trees.  I greatly wish we could have gone
there this trip.  At anyrate, Jack, I shall endeavour
to show you something quite as interesting, and
assuredly far more ancient.'
</p>

<p>
That afternoon they reached a certain spot from
which a magnificent view was obtainable, and the
ponies were brought to a stand.  Some thirty miles
away, in a southerly direction, the placid and
sparkling Java Sea lay spread out below them,
small blue clouds here and there dotting the horizon
and denoting islands, while toward the south-east
mountains rose twelve and thirteen thousand feet.
From two of them Jack perceived faint traces of
smoke rising.
</p>

<p>
'Volcanoes, sir!' he cried.
</p>

<p>
'Yes,' Mr. Sergeant replied, 'and there are many
of them throughout the island.  I know of four
which stand round an immense desert of sand, itself
the bottom of an extinct crater, and others near
Soerabaya are always active.  Eighty years ago one
named Papandajan suddenly became active, one
side of it was blown out, and four thousand people
were instantly destroyed.  Thirty years later the
island of Sombava, three hundred miles off, was
almost obliterated by an earthquake, and only after a
violent volcanic eruption did the fearful disturbance
cease, and many thousands of natives lost their lives
then; the shock was severely felt for one thousand
miles round, and vast quantities of lava dust fell
on this island.  Indeed, although everything looks
peaceful now, no one knows when a similar outburst
may happen.'
</p>

<p>
As a matter of fact, scarcely twenty years later
the Sunda Strait was entirely altered by earthquake,
and a volcanic eruption destroyed the island of
Krakatoa.  Java itself was also severely smitten, and
some thirty thousand people killed; while even in
England, thousands of miles away, the magnificent
sunsets visible about that time were accounted for
by the impalpable lava dust held in suspension and
slowly spreading all over the world.
</p>

<p>
Jack listened to the story, and that night saw
flames issuing from the two craters, and immediately
determined to send his father a long account of his
most interesting adventures, and also described how
kind Captain Thorne and Mr. Sergeant had been.
</p>

<p>
After several days of most interesting experiences
the party arrived at the end of their outward journey,
and at a village of some size found suitable
accommodation.
</p>

<p>
Next morning they again set out for a short drive,
and presently reached a plain of considerable extent,
where, almost in its centre, Jack Clewlin beheld a
most wonderful spectacle.
</p>

<p>
Before him, and in terrace after terrace of pinnacles,
spires, and domes, there rose to a height of about
one hundred and fifty feet a most extraordinary
combination of temples, shrines, and bas-reliefs of
the life and manners of people long dead and
forgotten, but who, in their eagerness to perpetuate
their religion, had executed this marvellous work
in honour of their heathen deity, Buddha.
</p>

<p>
'What do you think of it, captain?' Mr. Sergeant
inquired.
</p>

<p>
'Think!' the old man exclaimed; 'why, it is
simply astonishing.  I have heard of it, but thought
it was quite a small affair.  It must be four or five
miles round.'
</p>

<p>
'It is three miles in circumference.  I have spent
weeks at a time in examining its marvellous wonders,
one of the most magnificent creations in the world.
It covers nine acres; the great central dome which
you see rising over all is fifty feet in diameter.
There are no less than four hundred and forty-one
images of Buddha, nearly all of them being seated
within separate shrines of beautiful stone lattice
work, and over fifteen hundred bas-relief pictures
representing the life and manners of that distant
period.'
</p>

<p>
'When was it done?' the captain inquired.
</p>

<p>
'The actual date is not known,' Mr. Sergeant
replied; 'but from the most reliable sources it
appears to have been executed somewhere about
the eighth or ninth century of the Christian
era.'
</p>

<p>
'More than a thousand years ago,' the skipper
said.  'It is indeed a wonderful piece of work, and
must have employed vast numbers of people.'
</p>

<p>
'And yet not many visitors come to see it,'
Mr. Sergeant added.  'Of course, that is wholly owing
to the Dutch dislike of having strangers roaming
about, and writing of what they have seen or heard.'
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap09"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IX
<br /><br />
TOWARD SINGAPORE
</h3>

<p>
For nearly three days the party remained on
the spot, closely examining the ancient
Buddhist temples of Boro Boedoer, all
three of them being fascinated by the extraordinary
monument of bygone times, and, indeed, Mr. Sergeant
could with difficulty bring himself to leave
the neighbourhood.
</p>

<p>
'As I have told you,' he said, 'I have spent much
leisure time here, and each visit finds something
fresh to attract attention.  There is something
strange and mysterious about it all, and beside that
I am a bit of an archæologist.'
</p>

<p>
With much regret Jack Clewlin packed his spare
gear, and with the ponies homeward-bound soon left
all trace of the temples far behind.
</p>

<p>
Considerable progress was made.  At the old
halting-places the animals were changed, and without
further incident Mr. Sergeant and his guests arrived
at Batavia, a memorable excursion of slightly over
three weeks' duration thus coming to a close.
</p>

<p>
'I do not know how to thank you sufficiently, sir,'
Jack exclaimed, as his host took final leave of him;
'but I never enjoyed anything so splendid.'
</p>

<p>
'You are heartily welcome, my boy,' Mr. Sergeant
replied.  'I only wish the trip could have been
prolonged, but business is business, you understand,
and I expect that your sailing orders have by this
time arrived.  When you see your father, mention me.
Years ago, Jack, he did me a great service that can
never be forgotten, and I should be only too pleased
to see you again, whenever you visit these parts.'
</p>

<p>
'Thank you, sir,' Jack replied.
</p>

<p>
'Just one word more before we part,' Mr. Sergeant
continued.  'Wherever you go, and whatever you
undertake, be careful to act with straightforward zeal
on behalf of those you serve.  Never hurt any man,
and never forget to hold strong control over yourself,
since that will give strength to command others.
You are young now, and may at times be tempted
by less honourable associates.  Shun them as you
would avoid poison, since once you lose your own
self-respect you are sure to fail.  Good-bye, Jack;
fear God always, and keep your honour safe.  Don't
forget my respects to your father.'
</p>

<p>
'No, sir,' Jack replied.  'And I shall endeavour to
act up to your advice.'
</p>

<p>
Mr. Statten was particularly pleased to find the
lad once again on board, and prepared for duty,
while the chief officer gave him a smile on crossing
the gangway.  As for Readyman, he immediately
made inquiry as to how Jack had enjoyed his long
'liberty' on shore.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, man, I have seen such wonderful things!'
Jack exclaimed; 'flies that sail round of nights with
lights to guide them, not red and green ones like
ours, but white.  I saw smoking&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Dutchies!' Readyman exclaimed.  'They do that
all day, and most of the night, I believe.'
</p>

<p>
'Volcanoes,' Jack continued.  'And those fellows
ashore eat more at one meal than would serve the
starboard side of our fo'c's'le for one whole day.
Mr. Sergeant&mdash;&mdash;  By the way, Readyman, he said
he knew you, and was supercargo of the "Isabella."'
</p>

<p>
'Ay, ay, sonny, I mind him well.  He and your
dad were always very thick; and he only escaped
drowning by the skin of his teeth, as we say.'
</p>

<p>
'Well, it was he who gave us that splendid outing,
and I shall never forget those temples.  You should
have seen them, Readyman.  Mr. Sergeant said they
are more than a thousand years old.'
</p>

<p>
'I'm glad you've had such a good time, my son,
and can now stick your toes into the work aboard,'
the quarter-master replied.
</p>

<p>
When Captain Thorne returned on board that
night the news soon spread fore and aft that orders
to proceed to Singapore had been received, and that
the 'Alert' would probably sail from there either to
Calcutta or Hong Kong.
</p>

<p>
First thing next morning Mr. Sennit, the chief
officer, came along singing out, 'All hands bend sails!'
and throughout that day the work went with a swing.
</p>

<p>
As for Jack Clewlin, he had already become so
accustomed to the task that both royals were secured
to their yards in record time, and from them he slid
down to the topgallant and lower yards, reeving
bunt lines and reef-tackles, and, in short, striving to
show how thankful he was for that magnificent spell
ashore.  After that work was completed the anchor
gear, cat and fish falls were rove.
</p>

<p>
To the surprise of all hands, the lately landed
Germans came off begging a passage to Singapore,
since their skipper had gone home, and no employment
could be obtained among the few ships in the
roadstead.
</p>

<p>
Captain Thorne considered the matter, and finally
granted their request, and that kindness subsequently
proved of the utmost importance to everyone on board.
</p>

<p>
The boat being hoisted in and secured in its davits,
all hands manned the windlass, and to the cheery
chanty:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'As I went awalking one morning in May,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ho, rio,<br />

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Up and down went the levers, and the pawls
clicked cheerily till the cable was hove short.  Every
stitch of canvas fore and aft was sheeted home and
mastheaded, and with the tripping of the anchor the
'Alert' canted her head seaward, and careening to
the breeze in ballast trim speedily left Batavia far
astern.
</p>

<p>
With a light five-knot wind she proceeded northward
through the Java Sea, and for a few days all
went well.
</p>

<p>
Immediately after she had passed through Billiton
Passage, which separates the island of that name
from the southern coast of Borneo, the hitherto
magnificent weather underwent a considerable change,
the outlook presaging an approaching gale, and the
barometer fell with steady persistency.
</p>

<p>
'We're in for a sharp blow, Master Jack,' Readyman
observed.  'It will be short, but lively, as usual in
these seas, and you will face the first really stiff
breeze since leaving home.'
</p>

<p>
'Well, I've had a long run of luck in that way,'
Jack replied, 'and would have preferred more sea
room.  Mr. Statten let me see his chart, and we
seem to be surrounded by small islands.'
</p>

<p>
'She'll be all right, my son; but I'd get my
oilskins on as soon as possible,' Readyman
advised.
</p>

<p>
Throughout the afternoon the wind steadily
strengthened, and the barque, close-hauled, lay
down to it pretty freely, while both royals and the
flying jib and gaff-topsail were stowed.
</p>

<p>
With approaching night the weather stiffened
considerably; rain fell heavily, and at eight bells,
eight o'clock, the two topgallant-sails were furled,
while the outer jib came in on its boom.  As by
that time the wind had increased to gale force, with
every indication of 'dirtier' weather to follow, out
went the order, 'All hands reef topsails!'
</p>

<p>
The mainsail was hauled up, and all the
reef-tackles were hauled out.  From Mr. Statten a
couple of men received the reef-earings, or lengths
of light rope by which the head corners, or 'cringles,'
as they are termed, of the sails are fastened to the
yards, and away aloft through stinging rain and
whistling wind the men hastened to execute the
orders.
</p>

<p>
Mindful of Readyman's former advice to 'be
always on the spot when needed,' Jack Clewlin
worked his way out to the weather yardarm, and,
securing good foothold, assisted in reefing the
canvas.  Yet he soon discovered that all his work
was cut out to keep pace with the nimble movements
of his stronger and more experienced companion,
since, of course, the men nearer the mast had to
wait until the work outside was done.
</p>

<p>
That being completed, down wind went the cry,
'Haul out to lee'ard!'
</p>

<p>
The men passed the 'news' along.  Mr. Statten
at the mast shouted, 'Taut band!  Tie up!'  And
having fastened the reef-points, all hands slid to
the deck, seized the topsail halyards, and to the
lively chanty:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Up aloft that yard must go,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whisky, Johnny,'<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
the main topsail was reset 'taut leach,' while the
fore topsail was also reefed, and the mainsail was
stowed.
</p>

<p>
'That will do, starboard watch,' the old man, who
never left the deck during that night, sang out, and,
glad of a respite, Jack turned in.
</p>

<p>
But half his watch below had been spent on the
yards, and on resuming duty the foresail had to be
reefed; but the inner jib and the spanker had been
stowed and reefed.
</p>

<p>
The gale showed no sign of abatement, nor the
barometer any inclination to rise, while the barque,
owing to her height above water, drifted to leeward
somewhat faster than was deemed safe in such
confined seas.  She was, therefore, 'wore round'
on the port tack.
</p>

<p>
Dawn was breaking just as the port watch went
below, but the heavy rain and flying spume cut
from the wave-tops by the wind, rendered it impossible
to see any distance.
</p>

<p>
For a couple of hours nothing of moment occurred.
Shortly after seven o'clock that morning, and
during a sudden 'lifting' of the surrounding gloom,
the lookout reported the loom of land right
ahead.
</p>

<p>
Captain Thorne dropped his coffee-cup and rushed
on deck, just in time to perceive the danger, and
without a moment's hesitation he ordered the helm
to be eased.
</p>

<p>
'I knew it was not far off,' he said; 'but we have
drifted faster than I had allowed for.  That may be
due to a tide or a current.  We can't knock about
here in such weather, and will find shelter until the
gale passes.'
</p>

<p>
He sent a hand with the lead-line into the main
chains.
</p>

<p>
Under her easy canvas the 'Alert' forged ahead.
The island, which seemed uninhabited and thickly
covered with timber, soon became quite distinct, and
well sheltered from the wind under its lee the barque
dropped her anchor in four fathoms.
</p>

<p>
All the canvas, excepting the fore topmast
staysail and the spanker, which helped to keep the
vessel quiet at her cable, was stowed, but even
from aloft no sign of habitation could be seen.
</p>

<p>
Toward noon that day the barometer rose rapidly,
and within a few hours the gale had passed as
quickly as it arose, and the water under the lee
shore became as smooth as if nothing had occurred.
By four o'clock there was such a calm that the
'Alert' could not leave her anchorage.
</p>

<p>
Captain Thorne felt a little anxious, yet he
determined to visit the island, and discover if it was
really unoccupied.
</p>

<p>
'There won't be any wind before to-morrow
morning,' he observed to Mr. Statten; 'and if you
get a boat ready we'll go ashore.'
</p>

<p>
That was soon done, and Jack Clewlin took the
bow oar.
</p>

<p>
They presently passed a low point, and on its
farther side discovered a narrow creek that seemed
to run some distance inland.
</p>

<p>
'We'll follow it up,' the captain said.  'At the
same time, men,' he added thoughtfully, 'keep your
eyes wide open, so as not to fall into any trap.
Although the Dutch own most of the land hereabouts,
their Malay subjects are the most notorious pirates
on earth.'
</p>

<p>
'Ay, ay, sir,' the crew returned.
</p>

<p>
The creek narrowed down to no more than a
couple of fathoms across, and seemed to terminate
in dense foliage.  But on reaching that the men
could perceive a large lake-like stretch of water
beyond.  There was no difficulty in pushing the
boat through the leafy screen.  Then, taking to the
oars, the men pulled ahead, until a native village of
some size suddenly appeared.
</p>

<p>
The houses were erected on platforms several feet
over the water, and those on shore were similarly
built.  People moved about the beach, women being
apparently the chief workers, and for some seconds
the boat remained unseen.
</p>

<p>
'Backwater all,' the captain whispered.  'We've
struck a hornets' nest, and haven't even a revolver
handy.'
</p>

<p>
The next moment, however, much shouting ashore
announced the discovery of the intruders, and many
dusky figures hastened to the water's edge.
</p>

<p>
The captain, believing that a hasty retreat might
arouse the suspicions or the contempt of the natives,
ordered a stoppage.  As long as no canoes came
alongside, the people might suppose the visitors were
armed.
</p>

<p>
Most of the islanders were nearly naked.  Some
of them, however, wore shirts, and others tight-fitting
pantaloons, while one of apparent importance was
dressed in loose dirty-looking Eastern robes.  He
stood apart, and beckoned to the captain to approach,
and also hailed him in the Dutch language, which,
of course, no one in the boat understood.
</p>

<p>
Captain Thorne, standing erect in the stern sheets,
signified his ignorance of that tongue, whereupon the
stranger, much to the astonishment of his hearers,
inquired in fairly intelligible English if the visitors
were British born.
</p>

<p>
'Yes,' the old man replied.  'I hope we have not
given offence.  We thought the island was
uninhabited, and are seeking for fresh water.'
</p>

<p>
'Where you shippee?' was the next query.
</p>

<p>
'At anchor outside.'
</p>

<p>
'Me savvee plenty.  S'pose you come 'shore.  Me
likee Englishman, but Dutchman no good.  He
plenty shoot bibbee, women, an' leedle boy an' girl.
You come 'shore.'
</p>

<p>
'Ah,' the skipper suavely returned, 'I no likee
stop long from my ship.  You see, sun him nearly
go sleep now, an' me no find way back.  S'pose you
come with me, I give plenty biskit and chop-chop,
all same Singapore.'
</p>

<p>
Much to his surprise the invitation was promptly
accepted.  The boat's nose touched the beach, and
without the slightest sign of hesitation or suspicion
the Malay took a seat in the stern.
</p>

<p>
Captain Thorne was quite aware that he and his
companions were completely at the mercy of the
people, who looked a thoroughly unprincipled crowd,
and to whose ferocity many a defenceless and
unsuspecting crew may have owed their destruction.
He was not long left in doubt respecting the character
of those among whom he had fallen.  Before the
boat had again got under way many canoes, as if by
magic, had been dragged from their places among
the adjacent scrub, and only the sharp, resounding
voice of their leader prevented the crews from making
short work of their victims.
</p>

<p>
'You no 'fraid of them,' the Malay exclaimed.
'Me all same big man next to the chief.  Me likee
you, an' go Singapore.  S'pose dem feller no go
'shore, me kill them.  Savvee?'  He sang out again,
and the whole fleet of canoes disappeared.
</p>

<p>
On reaching the overhanging screen of foliage, a
clear passage for the boat was kept by many canoes,
and on clearing it others were seen to be paddling
out toward the 'Alert.'
</p>

<p>
In the most natural manner Captain Thorne
laughed and chatted with his guest, a dark-skinned,
low-browed, keen-eyed, and active Malay of about
thirty years.
</p>

<p>
He also readily answered every question respecting
the size of the barque, her armament, and the
strength of the crew.
</p>

<p>
The stranger appeared satisfied, and the skipper,
having duly impressed on his hearer the fighting
capabilities of the 'Alert,' felt almost confident that
he would yet emerge unscathed from what seemed
a somewhat awkward position.
</p>

<p>
Escape unharmed he did, and in a most extraordinary
and praiseworthy manner.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER X
<br /><br />
IN A PIRATE'S STRONGHOLD
</h3>

<p>
On reaching the barque the Malay promptly
sprang up the rope ladder which Mr. Sennit
had ordered to be lowered, but on reaching
the gangway he drew back quickly, as if fearing
treachery.
</p>

<p>
'What's the matter?' the captain inquired.
</p>

<p>
'You men no shoot?' the other nervously
exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
'Shoot? certainly not.  Go ahead, man; there is
nothing to fear.'
</p>

<p>
The Malay thus assured stepped on deck, and
peered inquiringly at the mate.
</p>

<p>
On reaching them Captain Thorne immediately
perceived the cause of alarm, and with difficulty
repressed his satisfaction of Mr. Sennit's measures
to prevent attack, and impress his dusky-hued visitor.
</p>

<p>
The whole crew, with the Germans working their
passage to Singapore, were ranged across the deck.
All the men were armed with muskets, old cutlasses,
and several long spears, captured on the island in
Torres Strait.  In close order they stood at the
'ready,' each man awaiting the order to fire on the
canoes approaching, and keenly watching their
movements.
</p>

<p>
Such a spectacle visibly affected the Malay,
especially as he also perceived that a formidable-looking
brass-mounted eight-pounder gun stood at
each side of the cabin, which could sweep the deck
of every opponent.  They were, however, only put
there for show, since being very old they dared not
be discharged.  'Ho, ho!' the visitor exclaimed, and
grinned till his red-stained teeth appeared.  'You
plenty men an' gun, cappee.  Me likee go Singapore
'long of you.'
</p>

<p>
'All right,' the skipper laughingly returned; but
he had no idea that his guest meant what was said.
</p>

<p>
The sharp eyes of the Malay seemed to take in
everything at a glance.  He made no attempt to
break through the 'guard of honour' ranged across
the deck, and followed the captain to the saloon.
He remained to tea, and became greatly interested
in his host.
</p>

<p>
The latter laughed and chatted in the most friendly
manner, as though nothing unusual was passing, and
of the scores of natives already on the deck he took
not the slightest notice.
</p>

<p>
'S'pose you come 'shore to-mollow morning,' the
visitor said at parting; 'me show big chief.  Him
likee Engleeshman.'
</p>

<p>
The captain agreed to do so, and with all his men
the Malay returned home.
</p>

<p>
'We must be obliging, Sennit,' the skipper observed.
'Should a breeze come, we'll clear out.  If not, I'll
show we are not afraid.'
</p>

<p>
'Better remain on board,' the mate advised.  'You
may go just a step too far in trusting them, and the
result might be fatal.'
</p>

<p>
'That fellow seemed friendly enough,' the old man
replied.  'At anyrate, while this calm lasts we're
more or less at their mercy, and that is what I do
not wish them to know.'
</p>

<p>
A double watch was set, and the night passed
quietly, save for the unceasing noise of bull-frogs and
countless insects ashore.
</p>

<p>
Bright and early next morning the captain came
on deck, and as the calm still hung over the island
he made preparations for visiting it.
</p>

<p>
'Clewlin,' he exclaimed, 'after breakfast, put on all
your best gear, and come ashore with me.  Never
before did I see the use of a brass-bound suit, but
I now believe that with you in one, the rascals will
think the barque a man-o'-war.'
</p>

<p>
The boat was soon ready, but cleared of everything
likely to be stolen, and even the brass rowlocks were
replaced by 'grummits,' or rings of rope spliced
through the holes on the gunwales.
</p>

<p>
Before starting, the skipper put a loaded revolver
in an inner pocket, gave another to Mr. Statten, and
borrowing the mate's put it in the hands of Readyman,
the coxswain.
</p>

<p>
'Take particular care that they are only used in
self-defence, and not even shown as a threat to
anyone,' he advised.  'Our last night visitor came here
entirely unarmed, and I shall not be outdone by any
nigger in that way.  Be firm, but friendly, my lads,'
he added, 'and mind that all show a bold front to
any hostile demonstration.  In that way we shall
probably overawe them.  Should any of you prefer
to remain on the barque, now's your chance.'
</p>

<p>
'We ain't agoing to desert you, sir,' Readyman
replied.
</p>

<p>
'No fear,' the others added.
</p>

<p>
So the boat pushed off, and soon reached the
screening trees that hid the larger stretch of water
beyond.  The place was as deserted as though no
one lived within miles of it.  Immediately after
passing through, a flagstaff with British ensign was
set up in the bow, and with the grand old red emblem
flying gaily overhead the boat was steered toward the
village.
</p>

<p>
On seeing it, scores of almost nude men rushed into
the water, and seizing the gunwales, despite the
strong dissent of the captain, would have dragged
them all up the beach, had not the headman fortunately
appeared, and by the liberal use of a short-handled
whip speedily restored order.
</p>

<p>
'You no likee boat pull up?' he inquired.
</p>

<p>
'She would be better afloat,' the captain said, since,
of course, he saw that with her in their possession all
hope of retreat would be cut off, should anything
unpleasant arise.
</p>

<p>
With Readyman in charge she was anchored about
six fathoms from the beach, the flag still waving over
her, while the gallant captain, with Jack Clewlin
stationed between him and Mr. Statten, set out with
the Malay to visit the chief of the island.
</p>

<p>
'My name all same Kalli Lal,' the guide explained.
</p>

<p>
He and the skipper exchanged cigars, while in
Indian file the little party soon entered a narrow and
tortuous path cut through the adjacent bush, till
quite unexpectedly they came to a large clearance
and immediately opposite a dwelling of considerable
size, erected on upright posts six feet above the
ground.
</p>

<p>
A flight of somewhat rickety-looking steps led to
the front door.  At their head a swarthy-hued, fierce-eyed,
yet intelligent man of about thirty years, was
seated in an arm-chair of undoubted European
manufacture, and he smoked a long native cheroot.
Of medium height and active figure, the stranger
watched the approach of the visitors, but, unlike
Kalli Lal, he was attired in ordinary English style
and wore a small black moustache.
</p>

<p>
'Him all same big chief,' the guide whispered.
</p>

<p>
Captain Thorne stepped forward and raised his hat.
The compliment was immediately returned, while
removing his cigar, and in very fair English the
head of the island welcomed the visitors.  Never for
one moment, however, did his penetrating, hawk-like
glance wander from those who had so boldly entered
the ever-dangerous presence of the piratical chief.
Yet, in spite of all his apparent desire to strike terror
into the hearts of the white men, the haughty
glance was as fiercely returned, since well they
knew that the slightest sign of nervousness might
cost all their lives.
</p>

<p>
On reaching the foot of the stairs two objects of
interest immediately attracted attention, and went
far to prove, if, indeed, proof were needed, the
manner of life followed by these people.  On the
right hand stood the full length figure of a woman
carved in wood, the loosely flowing garments seeming
to be stirred by the wind, while one arm was
outstretched, the whole still showing faint traces of
white paint; and beneath the bared right foot was
plainly discernible the words 'Olive Branch,' also in
carved letters.
</p>

<p>
The figure on the left hand represented a male-clad
warrior of olden times; a sunken cross, two inches
wide, being cut on the breast, and below the word
'Crusader' appeared.  Where were the vessels from
which those mute figure-heads had been removed, or
what fate had overtaken their crews?
</p>

<p>
Perhaps in the dead of night, and while helplessly
becalmed near this very island, the unsuspecting and
ill-fated men had been surprised and slaughtered,
and the ships and their cargoes might be hidden
away in some creek adjacent to the chief's 'palace.'
</p>

<p>
Captain Thorne failed to recall any missing
vessels of recent times named as those here
represented had been, while from the weather-beaten,
and in some places rotting, appearance of the figures
he concluded that they must have been placed in
position many years previously, and that this
fierce-eyed and somewhat treacherous-looking chief had
had no hand in the murders.
</p>

<p>
Accompanied by Kalli Lal the visitors ascended
the stairs, and on entering the 'palace' suddenly
faced a double line of immovable figures, apparently
acting as a 'guard of honour,' the smooth velvet-like
brown bodies being nude to the waist.  Each wore
in a bright-coloured sash several dangerous-looking
long knives, and also gripped between his teeth a
similar weapon with twisted blade.
</p>

<p>
Such a formidable array was calculated to impress
and probably test the nerves of the spectators; yet,
so far as Captain Thorne was concerned, the design
signally failed.  Without hesitation he followed the
chief down the lines, and in passing saluted them in
the most correct and dignified manner.
</p>

<p>
For one moment Jack Clewlin caught the searching
glance of Kalli Lal fixed on his protectors, and he
thought that an approving smile crossed the Malay's
lips; but the next moment a bamboo screen of native
make was drawn aside, and the party entered a
chamber of considerable dimensions, and almost
wholly furnished after the European manner.
</p>

<p>
Several oil paintings, chiefly seascapes, hung on
the walls, a couple of Oriental couches appeared in
the centre of the room, but the remainder of the
settees, chairs, and even a handsome round walnut
table, were of undoubted British manufacture.
</p>

<p>
With considerable grace the chief waved his guests
to their respective seats, and, motioning toward a
dusky-hued servant, quantities of bananas, mangoes,
pineapples, and other kinds of fruit were immediately
placed on the table.
</p>

<p>
All hands partook of the fruit, excellent coffee was
served in cups and saucers of English design and
work, after which a quantity of cheroots were
distributed all round, and Captain Thorne excused
his young 'midshipman' from participation in the
soothing weed.
</p>

<p>
'You see,' he explained to the chief, 'we do not
wish our young gentlemen to indulge in tobacco
before they are fully grown, and my boy has never
smoked a cigar.'
</p>

<p>
The chief nodded assent, and seemed satisfied.
</p>

<p>
'By the way,' the old man added, 'do not let me
forget to thank you for the honour accorded just now.
It was quite unexpected, but meant, I suppose, as a
return for the compliment offered by my first
lieutenant.'
</p>

<p>
'We are always pleased to see Englishmen and
their vessels here,' the chief replied.
</p>

<p>
'I am certain of that,' the other significantly
returned.  'You speak excellent English.'
</p>

<p>
'Well,' the Malay replied, 'I have always
endeavoured to do so.  When only eight years old I
was sent to Singapore to be educated, and there
received what knowledge I possess.  I like the
English, but hate all Dutchmen, since they not alone
shoot down our men, but the women and children
too.  You seem to have been somewhat interested in
those figure-heads outside.  Well, of the ships to which
they belonged I know nothing, and my father, who
was but twenty-four years old when killed while
tiger-hunting on the main coast, knew little of their
history.  I think it was my grandfather who seized
them, in mistake for Dutch vessels, and the figures
have been there ever since I can remember anything.'
</p>

<p>
Captain Thorne made no further inquiries on that
point, but for some minutes conversation seemed to
flag.  To avert such an awkward contingency, and
at the same time display entire ease amidst the
peculiar surroundings, he promptly related some
highly amusing incidents experienced during his
seafaring career, and aroused such hilarity amongst
both white and coloured companions that all reserve
was abandoned, and a most pleasant time ensued.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, it was not long before his rapidly moving
mind devised another means of diversion, since
suddenly wheeling on his chair he faced the youngest
member of the party.
</p>

<p>
'Clewlin,' he exclaimed, 'Sennit told me that he
heard you singing very nicely that night you turned
him out twenty minutes before his time.  Now then,
stand up and give us a good song, and a still better
chorus.'
</p>

<p>
Jack's face flushed crimson, and he looked
somewhat abashed.
</p>

<p>
'Steady, my lad,' the old man thoughtfully
observed.  'You remember what I told you this morning.
Be not afraid.  These gentlemen say they like
Englishmen, and will also like a good British song.
Is not that so, chief?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes,' came the prompt reply; 'I would wish to
hear him sing.'
</p>

<p>
Whereupon Jack pulled himself together for
the strange effort, and there, in the very midst of
a piratical stronghold, gave in clear, rising tones the
immortal 'Death of Nelson.'
</p>

<p>
At first the natives expressed no particular emotion,
but when the words&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Along the lines the signal ran,<br />
  England expects that every man<br />
  This day will do his duty,'<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
were taken up handsomely in the deep bass of the
skipper and the really fine baritone of Mr. Statten, it
seemed as though the roof of the apartment would be
carried away, while the astounded Malays sat
open-mouthed from sheer surprise and pleasure.
</p>

<p>
Thus gallantly supported Jack rose to the occasion,
never before had he put such strength and desire to
please into any vocal rendering, and line after line
was given with such accuracy and fire that the chorus
attracted hundreds of silent listeners to the spot.
When the song at length died away Captain Thorne
sprang from his chair, seized Jack's hand, and gave
utterance to the most vociferous, 'Hip, hip, hurrah!'
ever heard on that densely-timbered island.
</p>

<p>
It was indeed a sufficiently memorable incident,
and certainly greatly impressed the audience, since,
surely, visitors such as these must be strongly backed
up by much powder and guns thus to act in face of
contemplated attack!
</p>

<p>
After more coffee was served the entire party
proceeded to inspect the 'fields,' where women and
girls were busily employed attending to different
crops, and all hailed the chief with respect.
</p>

<p>
About five o'clock that afternoon the captain
expressed a desire to return to his vessel; and,
accompanied by the chief, the three visitors found
the boat quite unmolested.  The entire community
had assembled on shore to discuss the meaning of the
wonderful outburst of singing lately enjoyed.
</p>

<p>
As the old man took his seat in the stern-sheets,
Kalli Lal reminded him of the offer made to give him
a passage to Singapore.
</p>

<p>
'S'pose you want good pilot, cappee,' he said.
'Me takee you quick Singapore.'
</p>

<p>
'Are you ready?' the skipper inquired; for,
although he did not want to be burdened with more
hands, he knew that by passing through a certain
narrow channel the voyage might be materially
shortened.
</p>

<p>
Kalli Lal hastened to complete his arrangements,
and it was decided that while the boat returned to the
barque the chief should follow in his own vessel.
</p>

<p>
The 'Alert' was soon reached, and some twenty
minutes later a beautiful spectacle was witnessed.
</p>

<p>
'Well,' Readyman exclaimed, in unfeigned delight,
'I never saw her equal.  Ain't she a beauty, Master
Jack?'
</p>

<p>
'Indeed she is,' Jack replied.
</p>

<p>
'Look at the handsome lines and the sheer,' the
quarter-master added.  'There isn't a yacht afloat
could come near her in the matter of sailing.'
</p>

<p>
'We saw nothing of her while ashore,' Jack
replied.
</p>

<p>
The cause of their outspoken admiration was a
long, low freeboard vessel of about thirty tons
measurement, the polished sides gleaming in the
level rays of the setting sun, while curling foam spread
wide from the sharp cut-water.
</p>

<p>
Along each side about twenty brown-skinned men
propelled her rapidly toward the barque; their
diamond-shaped paddles glittered like silver as
they rose and fell to the beat of tom-tom and a
monotonous drone of voices.
</p>

<p>
In the centre the chief and Kalli Lal sat beneath
a silken canopy, and were duly received by the
'guard of honour' drawn up for their reception
across the quarter-deck of the 'Alert.'
</p>

<p>
As the chief stepped on board he turned towards
his host.
</p>

<p>
'Are your men good shots?' he inquired.
</p>

<p>
'Walker,' the old man exclaimed, 'face for'a'd,
and hit the shark's fin nailed on the jib-boom end.'
</p>

<p>
The man thus addressed, the best marksman on
board, immediately obeyed, and sent the fin flying
from its place.
</p>

<p>
'They're all mostly like that,' Captain Thorne
observed to his companion.  'I'd back them to beat
five times their number.'
</p>

<p>
While the guests were being entertained in the
cabin, quantities of fruit, yams, sweet potatoes, a small
bag of coffee, and a few other gifts were passed from
the 'State-Barge' to the 'Alert.'  In return, two
bags of ship biscuit, several pots of jam, some tins of
preserved vegetables and milk were given by the
skipper, three old muskets and some powder were
also presented to the chief.
</p>

<p>
As by that time the sun had set, and a nice evening
breeze set in, Kalli Lal took leave of his master, and
with all his retainers the latter returned ashore.
</p>

<p>
All plain sail was promptly set on the barque.
The hands mustered at the windlass, and to the
chanty chorus:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Blow, boys, blow, for California row,<br />
  There's plenty of gold in the land, I'm told,<br />
  On the banks of Sacramento,'<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
the anchor was cat-headed and 'fished.'
</p>

<p>
To a good five-knot wind the barque presently
swung away from the densely-wooded island whereon
Captain Thorne and his companions had experienced
such stirring and strange adventures.  The 'Alert'
soon cleared its western end, and in the swiftly-deepening
night gloom presently lost all trace of it.
</p>

<p>
Kalli Lal made himself perfectly comfortable on
board, and also proved an excellent pilot, since with
accurate knowledge of every adjacent island he took
the vessel safely through a channel in which no other
British ship had, perhaps, ever floated, and after a
splendid run brought her to anchor near Singapore.

<h3>
CHAPTER XI
<br /><br />
THROUGH THE CHINA SEA
</h3>

<p>
Jack Clewlin now found himself in one of
the busiest ports of the world, where the ships
from the Far East and the Far West met in
commercial rivalry, and he was delighted to perceive
British colours flying above the Government buildings
ashore.  Yet the sight of the flag immediately aroused
an intense longing, such as hitherto had not been
experienced, to return to Stonewell, if only for a few
hours, and the desire proved almost overwhelming,
for he knew that the barque had now reached a
British possession, from which England might be
reached within a few weeks.  The eight or nine
thousand miles seemed insignificant when compared
with the countless leagues of ocean traversed by the
'Silver Crown' and the 'Alert.'
</p>

<p>
'Ay,' he mused, 'and if I put the clock back by
a few hours I can tell exactly what dear dad and
my old school chums are doing.  They seem very
close now.'
</p>

<p>
During such reflections, however, he suddenly
became aware that 'a floating chemist's shop,' as he
put it, was close aboard, and on passing forward he
met Readyman.
</p>

<p>
'Regular surgery smell, Master Jack,' the
quarter-master said.
</p>

<p>
'It's camphor,' Jack replied; 'where does it come
from?'
</p>

<p>
'That big Chinese junk, just anchored ahead of
us,' Readyman replied.  'It's almost enough to knock
you down, but very good for the head and lungs,
I'm told.'
</p>

<p>
'Perhaps that is why all Chinamen are such keen
bargainers,' Jack returned.  'She must be fairly
loaded with it.'
</p>

<p>
'I should say so,' the quarter-master said.  'But
look at the monstrous great stern.  That's enough to
send her scooting at ten knots, with the wind dead
aft.  They'll never build better craft.'
</p>

<p>
'At anyrate,' Jack added, 'she is like the ships
in which Sir Francis Drake and Captain Hawkins
captured many a good Spanish plate ship, long ago.
I have read of their adventures, and seen pictures of
the vessels.'
</p>

<p>
The unwieldy-looking junk was indeed vastly
different from anything Jack had hitherto seen afloat.
The huge wall-like stern, pierced with many windows,
rose high above the forecastle-head of the barque,
with the big rudder, looking like a semi-submerged
dock gate, abaft of all.
</p>

<p>
Yet many such craft, larger and smaller, lay among
British, American, French, Dutch, and Spanish ships
in the harbour, since Singapore, which is situated on
an island near the end of the Malay Peninsula, and
at the western entrance of Malacca Strait, is the
great port of call for vessels bound to the Far East,
and its exports of coffee, spices, indiarubber, tin,
and many other articles of commerce are considerable.
</p>

<p>
During the afternoon following the arrival of the
'Alert' at Singapore, a small outward-bound Dutch
steamer passed so close that everyone on board was
distinctly visible.  Among those assembled on the
quarter-deck Jack Clewlin recognised Kalli Lal.
</p>

<p>
'He must be going to Batavia,' the captain said.
'The rascal does not seem to recognise us.  Wave
your hand, Clewlin.'
</p>

<p>
The Malay, however, suddenly disappeared down
the cabin stairs without acknowledging the greeting.
</p>

<p>
'You may be sure that he's up to some trick or
other,' the old man observed, 'and does not wish to
be known.'
</p>

<p>
The steamer headed away for the distant islands
across the strait, and the incident was soon forgotten.
</p>

<p>
A few days later, however, it was recalled with
startling vividness, and in a manner little expected.
</p>

<p>
Having received orders to proceed to Hong Kong,
and filled her tanks and boats with fresh water and
fruit, the barque set all her canvas; but while the
hands&mdash;the Germans being sent ashore&mdash;were heaving
at the windlass, a boat manned by British bluejackets
was seen to be rapidly approaching.  In the stern
an officer waved the quarantine flag, as if to attract
attention.
</p>

<p>
'I believe they are coming here,' the captain, who
seemed much annoyed by the incident, observed.
'What can they mean?  My vessel is perfectly clean.'
</p>

<p>
'Perhaps they mistake us for some other craft,' the
mate said.
</p>

<p>
'"Alert," ahoy!' the lieutenant sang out.  'Pawl
your windlass.  I am coming alongside.  Have a line
ready.'
</p>

<p>
Captain Thorne expressed considerable annoyance
at the interference; but when the stranger reached
the deck the situation immediately assumed sufficiently
serious proportions.
</p>

<p>
'Veer away on your cable again,' the officer
ordered.  'Clew up and furl all the canvas.  Should
you disobey my commands, you will be followed
and brought back.'
</p>

<p>
'By what authority do you issue them?' the
skipper shortly inquired.
</p>

<p>
'By Her Britannic Majesty's Warrant of Detention,'
was the curt reply, and producing it the lieutenant
proceeded to secure it to the mainmast.
</p>

<p>
'What is the charge?' Captain Thorne inquired.
</p>

<p>
'Harbouring and assisting Malay pirates, headed
by one Kalli Lal,' the other replied.
</p>

<p>
'Kalli Lal!' the skipper exclaimed; 'he acted as
my pilot.  We sheltered under what was believed
to be an uninhabited island in Billiton Passage, but
found we had sailed into the very midst of a hornets'
nest.  To escape with whole skins, I took the fellow
on board.  Of his followers I know nothing.  What
have they been doing, sir?'
</p>

<p>
'Seized and almost destroyed everyone on board
a small Dutch steamer which left here a few days
since,' the lieutenant explained; 'and but for the
opportune arrival of a Dutch gunboat all hands would
have been massacred.  The skipper says he saw
signals pass between you and Kalli Lal when he
passed.'
</p>

<p>
'I will go with you,' Captain Thorne replied, 'and
will take my second officer and the apprentice.  They
can corroborate my statements.'
</p>

<p>
The barque was re-anchored, all her canvas was
stowed, and, leaving Mr. Sennit in charge, the
'prisoners' were conveyed to the British wardship
then in port.  The Dutch consul had also arrived.
</p>

<p>
After explanations and some discussion the court
adjudged the 'prisoners' free of blame, but at the
same time expressed a hope that greater care in
mixing with the natives should be observed.
</p>

<p>
'What more could I have done?' Captain Thorne
sharply observed.  'We were at the mercy of those
scoundrels, and thanked our stars when clear of
them.'
</p>

<p>
It appeared that Kalli Lal and his followers had
boarded the steamer, which was known to contain
considerable specie for Batavia, and when surprised
they made desperate resistance, till all were slain.
</p>

<p>
After this the Dutchmen turned their attention to
the island community and its chief.  The latter stoutly
denied all knowledge of the affair, and being unable
to bring any further charges of piracy against him the
Dutchmen spared his life, but kept him close prisoner
at Batavia.
</p>

<p>
Thus ended the strange adventure of Jack Clewlin
among Malay pirates; yet he was not to quit that
part of the world without another, but wholly different,
experience of life in Eastern waters.
</p>

<p>
The moment Captain Thorne returned to his vessel
orders to sail were issued.  With a fresh but contrary
wind the 'Alert' got under way, and throughout the
remainder of that day beat up through the Malacca
Strait for Hong Kong.  Toward sundown the wind
failed, and within an hour she was scarcely moving,
while a small island loomed darkly five miles off
the port bow.
</p>

<p>
From the forecastle-head Mr. Sennit reported the
stealthy approach of what looked like two large canoes
filled with men.  Captain Thorne peered at them
through his glasses, and believed that under cover of
night the natives intended to attack the vessel, or,
at anyrate, to steal whatever they could handle.
</p>

<p>
'They don't seem in much of a hurry, sir,' the mate
said.
</p>

<p>
'Of course not,' the old man replied.  'They'll lie
off on their paddles till midnight.  They can always
keep us in sight, and yet remain invisible.  Anyhow,
we are well-armed, Sennit, and should be able to hold
our own.'
</p>

<p>
All the firearms were loaded with ball cartridges
and served out; the old navy cutlasses and the dozen
long spears were laid ready for service on the main
hatch, while every light, save one small one in the
compass binnacle, was put out.  Lengths of hose
were attached to the head pump, so that in case of
assault the foe should be thoroughly drenched, and
thus, perhaps, escape worse treatment.
</p>

<p>
'I think, sir,' Mr. Sennit observed, 'that we might
also take the precaution of having the outer
chain-plates well greased.  Although the barque is high
out of the water, those rascals are exceedingly active,
and once they get a grip don't soon let go.'
</p>

<p>
'A capital idea,' the old man replied.  'There could
be no harm in trying the effect, and it may prove
advantageous.'
</p>

<p>
So the men set to work in the dark, smearing the
outer iron-work, to prevent the pirates from boarding.
All the while the vessel was becoming more and
more hopelessly becalmed, and the vigilance was, if
possible, redoubled.
</p>

<p>
The glasses of both captain and officers were in
constant use.  At every point of observation sentries
were set, to announce the first approach of the enemy,
and no one thought of going below, much less
indulging in a smoke.  The hours dragged heavily
away, but there was no sign of attack.
</p>

<p>
'I expect a silent rush about midnight, Sennit,'
the old man said.  'They know we are alone, and
probably think that a sudden swoop will catch us
napping.'
</p>

<p>
'And discover the mistake when too late,' the
mate added.
</p>

<p>
Hour after hour the men, musket on shoulder,
paced the deck, a keen lookout to port and starboard
being maintained; but nothing of the canoes or their
occupants could be perceived.
</p>

<p>
At last dawn began to show eastward.  The
adjacent island loomed weirdly above the thick
morning mist, lying low on the water.  As the light
strengthened into good promise of another cloudless
day, the lookout on the forecastle-head suddenly
reported the two canoes within musket range, slightly
off the port bow.
</p>

<p>
'Keep out of sight, men,' the captain whispered,
as with Mr. Sennit he hastened forward, and flat on
the deck peered through his glasses at the silent
enemy.
</p>

<p>
'Let us give them a volley,' the mate whispered.
</p>

<p>
'No, no,' the old man replied.  'They must be
the&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
The remainder of the sentence was never finished.
With peculiar deliberation the captain closed his
glasses, and sitting bolt upright looked fixedly at his
companion.
</p>

<p>
'Why, they're nothing but the trunks of <i>two dead
trees</i>!' he said.
</p>

<p>
'With the stump branches looking like men in the
gloom last night, sir,' Mr. Sennit added.  'I'm sure
they might have deceived anyone, and we were much
closer than I supposed.'
</p>

<p>
'Let the port watch go below,' the skipper said.
'You all did your best, and we were ready for anyone.
Can't be too particular hereabouts, anyhow.'
</p>

<p>
Whereupon all the weapons were returned to their
stands in the fore cabin, brooms and hose were
brought into use for the usual scrub down; but when
the fellows got into the chains to clear away the
grease, and beyond earshot of the captain, their
remarks respecting that night adventure among Malay
'pirates' proved sufficiently amusing.
</p>

<p>
At anyrate, it was not long before a light breeze
stiffened so quickly that the 'Alert' sped along in
good style, and speedily left Malacca Strait and its
numerous islands far astern.
</p>

<p>
'Now we're getting into the seas I have such good
cause to remember, Master Jack,' the quarter-master
observed.  'But for your dad I should certainly have
left my bones in them long ago.'
</p>

<p>
'I do not want such a terrible experience as that,
Readyman,' Jack replied.  'Are those typhoons
frequent?'
</p>

<p>
'Well, sonny,' the old sailor returned, 'so far as
my experience went they seem to come along several
times a year.  To be sure, all are not of the same
violence.  I think the worst are met during July or
August; but we may not fall in with them at all.
Anyhow, lad, you can never tell when they will
come.'
</p>

<p>
'But the barometer would show that,' Jack said.
</p>

<p>
'Possibly; but they drive down without much
warning.'
</p>

<p>
A few days later an amusing incident occurred.
Early one morning the 'Alert' fell in with another
barque, named the 'Speedwell,' bound for Hong
Kong with rice, and presently overhauled her.
</p>

<p>
During an exchange of signals Mr. Statten noticed
a large number of pigeons flying about the stranger,
and as Captain Thorne had also purchased a few
pairs of similar birds when at Singapore, he directed
Jack Clewlin to let them out for a fly, without the
least suspicion that such action would entail any
unpleasant dispute between himself and his brother
skipper.
</p>

<p>
The birds promptly rose on the wing in splendid
manner, and on perceiving their friends to leeward
went down there.  The laughing stranger expressed
his entire satisfaction and full determination to enjoy
a first-class pigeon-pie for dinner that day.
</p>

<p>
'With pleasure,' Captain Thorne replied; 'we shall
settle the account at Hong Kong.'
</p>

<p>
'Join me at one, sharp,' the other returned; 'regret
not being able to supply a boat.'
</p>

<p>
'Pray don't mention it,' was the polite rejoinder; 'I
expect to be in port about that time.  We will tell
them you're coming.  I am afraid we have lost the
birds, Statten,' he added.
</p>

<p>
Yet the remark was scarcely uttered, when up from
the 'Speedwell' rose all her birds, led by the visitors,
and having enjoyed a glorious flight through the
sun-filled atmosphere, quietly alighted on board the
'Alert.'
</p>

<p>
Captain Thorne made no sign.  Indeed, throughout
the incident he had been 'luffing up' all he could to
exchange compliments, but on suddenly discovering
how the birds had themselves declined to become
'pie,' and that they had no intention of returning, he
eased his helm, and with respectful dip of ensign left
his dismayed brother mariner far astern.
</p>

<p>
'He's signalling, sir,' Mr. Statten exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
'Not another invitation?' the old man inquired.
</p>

<p>
The second mate hastily turned over the leaves
of the signal-book, and, reading the numbers of the
fluttering flags, explained their meaning.
</p>

<p>
'I shall have the law of you at Hong Kong.'
</p>

<p>
Captain Thorne laughed merrily.  'Invite him to
dinner, Statten,' he said; 'turn about's fair play
anyhow.'
</p>

<p>
And thus for the time the incident ended.  When
the 'Speedwell' arrived at her destination, and
anchored near her late consort, the irate skipper
immediately ran alongside, only, however, to be met
by such a formidable array of long spears, old cutlasses,
and worn-out brass signal guns, that he determined
to defer the visit to a more opportune occasion, and
proceeding ashore took out a summons against the
delinquent captain for the return of his property.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Jack Clewlin had secured all the new
birds, which were speedily returned to their ship, the
result being that when called on for his defence
Captain Thorne could truthfully affirm that he did
not possess a single pigeon other than that purchased
in open market.
</p>

<p>
'Not got them, sir!' the angry skipper shouted;
'I wonder how you can say such words.  What has
become of them?'
</p>

<p>
'Went back to your vessel this morning,' was
the quiet reply.  The court roared with laughter.
</p>

<p>
'Come and dine with me,' Captain Thorne observed,
as his late accuser passed out of court; and down the
street both men proceeded arm-in-arm, each chatting
as merrily as though nothing had arisen to occasion
temporary misunderstanding.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XII
<br /><br />
ON THE COAST OF CHINA
</h3>

<p>
The island of Hong Kong, which was captured
by the British in the year 1839, and ceded to
them by the Chinese two years later, is
separated from the mainland by a narrow channel;
and although it is of no great extent it is lofty, with a
lookout station on the summit.  The town of Victoria,
named after Her Majesty the late Queen, lies along
the fore-shore, and is, of course, chiefly inhabited
by Chinese.  Even in Jack Clewlin's time it was a
port of considerable importance, a British governor
and regiment being located there; and its import and
export trade was large.
</p>

<p>
The most interesting fact was the large floating
population, itself forming a second town, which
managed to find a living on the water, entire families
of young and old people residing together in small
vessels, styled sampans, and many of them rarely
enjoyed a holiday ashore.
</p>

<p>
How they existed was a mystery.  The Chinaman
is famous for his thrifty habits, and can always find
means of securing a living where most other folk
would certainly starve.
</p>

<p>
Among those people a curious custom prevailed.
Each evening at sunset gongs were beaten and
crackers exploded, to scare away the malignant
spirits of the night, and the din thus raised was
great.
</p>

<p>
A few days after the arrival of the 'Alert' in
the harbour, a rumour that she had been chartered
to convey Chinese emigrants to San Francisco spread
fore and aft, and aroused much comment.
</p>

<p>
'It's likely to be true enough,' Readyman observed;
'but in my opinion, Master Jack, the less we have to
do with them the better it will be for all hands.'
</p>

<p>
'They would be cleaner than coal, and could walk
ashore instead of being winched into barges,' Jack
replied.
</p>

<p>
'Well, of course, that's true,' the quarter-master
returned.  'But I've seen more of them than, perhaps,
anyone on board, and I know that with half a chance
they will steal the eyes from your head, and you'd
never know till you missed them.  We've seen
something of the Malay pirates&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Which do you mean, Readyman?' Jack naively
inquired.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, that last lot didn't count,' the quarter-master
laughingly replied.  'Jokes aside, my son, the Malay
lot put together wouldn't match one gang out of
Canton River.  I've seen seven of them strung up
together for the seizure of a brig and the murder
of her entire crew.  You couldn't guess what they
did.  No, lad, not in a month of Sundays&mdash;they
lashed the poor fellows to the chain cable, and then
let it all run out, so that no one should discover what
had been done.  Anyhow, our people found it out and
choked the rascals.'
</p>

<p>
'Where is the Canton River, Readyman?'
</p>

<p>
'Why, quite close to us, sonny.  Do you see
that white-painted Yankee-built steamboat moored
alongside the wharf yonder? she makes the return
trip a couple of times a week.  Every man of the
white crew is always armed.  They know what to
expect, yet some of them get killed.
</p>

<p>
'If the rascally cut-throats would come out fair
and square in the daylight it wouldn't so much
matter.  A lot of them often ship as passengers,
with the leader doing the swell as a first cabin fare,
and before anyone can cry "Jack Robinson!" the
ship has been seized and her crew killed.'
</p>

<p>
'But all Chinamen are not pirates, Readyman.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh no, my son.  All the same, I wouldn't trust
one of them with a chew of tobacco.'
</p>

<p>
One morning, shortly after that conversation,
several English and Chinese gentlemen came on
board, and accompanied by Captain Thorne they
made a close examination of the barque.
</p>

<p>
Such a procedure proved the accuracy of the
rumour already rife.  Several carpenters soon arrived,
and speedily began to knock up tiers of bunks along
both sides of the 'tween deck.  There was no longer
any room for doubt respecting the conveyance of
emigrants.
</p>

<p>
One afternoon several other Chinese workmen
brought on board a quantity of iron-work, and within
a week it was firmly set up abreast of the mainmast,
right across the main deck, and even extended some
feet beyond the bulwarks.  It was twelve feet high,
with sharp-pointed spikes on top, with a small gate
on each side, through which the crew might pass
at will.
</p>

<p>
'But what is it for?' Jack inquired.
</p>

<p>
'Why, to keep the Chinamen from getting aft,
should they start any trouble,' Readyman replied.
'Every vessel in this trade is obliged to carry a
stockade.  Mind you, I'm not saying that this crowd
is going to show fight; many ships make successful
trips, but others have mysteriously disappeared, and
were never again seen or heard of.'
</p>

<p>
'How could they be navigated, or, if captured,
what could be done with such large craft?' Jack
exclaimed, since this talk naturally aroused considerable
interest in the subsequent career of the 'Alert,'
and he had no mind to 'lose the number of his mess,'
as sailors say it.  Yet, from what he had seen of
the Chinese, he could scarcely think them capable
of such behaviour.
</p>

<p>
'That's more than I could tell,' the quarter-master
returned.  'Perhaps they know enough to run them
ashore at some quiet spot on their own coast, or
somewhere in Japan.  But I don't believe those
folk would have anything to do with them.  See
here, what did that rascally Malay's grandfather
do with the "Olive Branch" and the "Crusader"?
At anyrate, all we've got to do is to keep a sharp
lookout, and trust in God.'
</p>

<p>
'Will our men still live in the forecastle?'
</p>

<p>
'I suppose so; but directly there's any sign of
a row they must scoot behind the stockade, and
bar the gates.'
</p>

<p>
Next day a considerable quantity of rice and
other food-stuffs was shipped as also extra tanks
for holding fresh water.  A secret supply of
ammunition, with many rifles to replace the old
muzzle-loading muskets till then in use, was taken
on board.
</p>

<p>
That work being completed, the first batch of
Chinese emigrants, eighty able-bodied men of quiet
demeanour, arrived alongside, and with their scanty
belongings they were immediately sent to their
quarters in the 'tween deck.  Some of them carried
small brass-bound boxes, but the majority possessed
only bundles wrapped in handkerchiefs, and scarcely
a bed could be mustered by the crowd.
</p>

<p>
A double anchor-watch was kept that night, but
nothing occurred to arouse anxiety or suspicion.
</p>

<p>
Early next morning, however, Jack Clewlin was
suddenly turned out, and was told that a typhoon
was threatening to sweep the harbour.
</p>

<p>
'Get your oilskins on at once,' Mr. Statten said.
'Mind that you put a strong belt round all outside,
or if the wind gets inside your gear you'll be blown
away.  We're in for a regular "howler," I'm afraid.'
</p>

<p>
By the time Jack got into the open both mates
were forward, singing out to the hands to send down
all the upper masts and yards.  In spite of the
utmost alacrity, however, only the royal yards reached
the deck, since the wind increased so rapidly that
no one could remain aloft.
</p>

<p>
The alarmed emigrants were next battened down
in the 'tween deck.  Then the second anchor was
'cock-billed' and let go.  Both cables were 'paid
out' almost to their last links, and they were secured
to the foremast.  The wind attained hurricane force,
and screamed through the rigging like a thousand
furies.
</p>

<p>
Despite her sheltered position under the high
mainland the vessel strained fearfully at her anchors,
and owing to her height above the water she was
frequently blown nearly on her beam-ends.  The
cries of the Chinamen down below could sometimes
be faintly heard, but as they were dry and
comparatively comfortable no notice was taken.
</p>

<p>
Amidst blinding rain and whirling spume all trace
of the adjacent town and island disappeared.  By
noon scarcely any daylight remained.  The clouds
seemed to almost touch the masts.  Volumes of
water, swept up by the terrible wind, poured over
the deck, and by two o'clock that afternoon the
anchors began to drag.  Nothing could be done to
prevent such peril.
</p>

<p>
Many of the hands believed that the vessel would
capsize.  With tremendous strain at the cables,
however, she always managed to swing head to
wind, and the expected catastrophe was averted.
</p>

<p>
The Chinamen continued to shout, and became
so panic-stricken that Captain Thorne warned their
headman, a burly, stubborn-looking fellow, that any
further disturbance would be severely dealt with.
</p>

<p>
About five o'clock that afternoon the typhoon was
at its height, and the fearful scream of the wind
and the blinding smother of rain and flying spray
were truly appalling.
</p>

<p>
A sudden lull of the tempest was followed by a
partial lifting of the obscurity.  Then it became
evident that the 'Alert' had been blown right away
from her innermost anchorage, past the town, and
was quite one mile to leeward.
</p>

<p>
The wind again increased, but not so strongly as
before.  Mr. Statten presently reported a sensible
rise of the barometer.
</p>

<p>
'Then the typhoon is passing away,' Captain
Thorne sang out.  'We won't drag any farther.
The sea is beginning to catch us out here.'
</p>

<p>
'It will soon go down, sir,' Readyman exclaimed,
'She's safe now.  The shelter of the land broke the
"heft" of the blow.'
</p>

<p>
By that time it had become intensely dark.  The
wind, however, was certainly not so strong, but the
troublesome sea did not tend toward an improvement
of the situation.  In spite of all her struggles the
barque did not emerge from that ordeal unscathed.
</p>

<p>
A violent shock was followed by the alarming cry,
'She's ashore!'  The next instant screams came aft
from the bow, and were followed by similar cries.
The heavy bumping of some weighty object along
the starboard side was also distinctly felt.  Many of
the hands immediately hastened that way.
</p>

<p>
Through the darkness loomed the huge form of a
Chinese junk, apparently unmanageable, driving aft
before the wind, and doing much injury in the
process.  As she drifted abreast of the mainmast all
the outer iron-work of the stockade was instantly
torn away.  Three or four Chinamen leaped from
their vessel on board the 'Alert,' and in their fall
were somewhat severely injured.
</p>

<p>
Most fortunately the junk had already been
dismasted, or she would certainly have brought down
some of the barque's spars.  Just as she drove clear
of the stern a piercing female scream rose from her
deck.  Then she disappeared.  Nothing could be done
to save the unfortunate woman, as no boat would have
floated for five minutes in the heavy sea.  By ten
o'clock that night the trouble had almost passed.
The vessel was holding her own.  The captain
ordered the galley fire to be relighted, and a hot
supper was served fore and aft.  The Chinamen
down below also became more amenable, and they
enjoyed a meal of boiled rice.
</p>

<p>
By sun-up next morning the typhoon had completely
passed away, and the sea near the land was quite
smooth.
</p>

<p>
To the surprise of all hands, Mr. Statten suddenly
reported that he could see the drifting junk of the
previous night's adventure still afloat three miles to
leeward.
</p>

<p>
A boat was promptly lowered, in hope of saving
anyone on her, and setting some canvas a volunteer
crew got alongside.  The woman was discovered
calmly cooking food for her four young children,
and evinced no anxiety for her safety.  She would
not leave her floating home; but the crew of
the boat espied a steamer bearing down toward
them, and the junk was finally towed back to
Victoria.
</p>

<p>
The injured Chinamen were sent to hospital.  The
damage to the 'Alert' was speedily repaired, and
thus ended Jack Clewlin's experience of a typhoon on
the coast of China.
</p>

<p>
The destruction among the numberless 'sampans'
huddled together along the fore-shore of the island
had been great, and many people lost their lives.
Not much injury was sustained among the shipping
in the harbour, which was entirely owing to the
off-shore direction of the wind.
</p>

<p>
When the barque had been again placed on the
active list, everything capable of holding fresh water
was filled, the sails were 'bent,' and the remainder
of the emigrants, sixty-five able-bodied men, were
received.  The 'Alert' was ready to start on her
voyage across the Pacific.
</p>

<p>
Only a few hours before leaving Hong Kong
young Jack received his third letter from home,
together with several 'Stonewell news-letters,' giving
him the latest information of how matters thereabout
were progressing.  In one of the papers he suddenly
saw the startling announcement, 'The loss of the
"Silver Crown".'  In breathless excitement he hurried
to the forecastle, and told Readyman the sad news.
</p>

<p>
It appeared that on her arrival at Point de Galle,
in Ceylon, for orders, the clipper had been sent to
Calcutta, and was there sunk in the Hoogly during
a cyclone.
</p>

<p>
'I hope the crew were saved, Master Jack,' the
quarter-master exclaimed.  'We did well in making
the exchange.'
</p>

<p>
'But seem to be going farther away from home all
the time,' Jack added.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, the more days the more dollars, lad,'
Readyman replied.  'Perhaps we may be chartered
to bring back here a hold full of dead Chinamen's
bones!  You needn't look so scared, my son; it's
often done.  I've never been in the trade myself, but
I know that every wandering pigtail makes it a point
of honour to have his bones sent home for interment.'
</p>

<p>
'What a pity that they don't remain where they
were born!' Jack exclaimed.  'They can live on
a handful of rice for a month, and grow fat on it,
too.'
</p>

<p>
'That's true, sonny,' the quarter-master said.  'I
hope this lot won't give us any trouble.'
</p>

<p>
'Mr. Statten told me that we are to carry a
wealthy heathen, partly as a saloon fare, and partly
as an interpreter,' Jack explained.  'Perhaps he may
be able to keep them quiet.'
</p>

<p>
'I hope so, lad.  At anyrate, we've plenty of
"fire-sticks" and ammunition.  They work wonders
at a pinch.'
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII
<br /><br />
FROM HONG KONG TO SAN FRANCISCO
</h3>

<p>
With a fine, fair wind, a smooth sea, a clear
outlook, and every opportunity for making
a good offing before nightfall, the 'Alert'
left her anchorage near Victoria.  And thus began
the most remarkable voyage of her career, and one
which was soon to become the most adventurous
experienced by any member of her crew.
</p>

<p>
By those on shore no apparent notice of the
departure was taken.  Some of the emigrants,
however, burned a few 'joss-sticks,' and ignited
several 'crackers,' to propitiate the malignant spirits
of the deep.
</p>

<p>
Out in the open sea a strong breeze was sweeping
across a wide expanse of sparkling water, the late
typhoon having cleared the atmosphere in splendid
manner.  The sun shone brilliantly, the coast-line of
China soon disappeared, and as quickly as the
studding-sail gear could be rove and rigged out the
canvas was set.
</p>

<p>
Captain Thorne and all hands were in high spirits
at having obtained so favourable a start for the
venture.  Indeed, everyone capable of forming an
accurate estimate of the run to California believed
that a record passage would be almost certain to
follow, and that the Chinamen would be landed
without the slightest mishap to anyone.
</p>

<p>
Still keeping the same fair wind the 'Alert' sped
across the China Sea, and passed safely through the
Bashee Channel, that lies between the large island
of Formosa and the Philippine Islands.  She had
now cleared all dangers of the land, and swept into
the blue depths of the North Pacific.
</p>

<p>
The weather continued beautifully fine.  All that
while not a yard or boom brace was touched, and
the wind-curved sails never stirred.  The barque
seemed to revel in the glorious sunlight, and 'reeled
off' daily runs that astonished Captain Thorne.
</p>

<p>
'It's grand, Master Jack,' Readyman exclaimed.
'I thought she did a tidy bit of scooting through
Torres Strait.  This bout fairly knocks the bottom
out of that.  I hope she'll keep on as she's going,
right up to the Golden Gates.'
</p>

<p>
'You mean the entrance to San Francisco Bay?'
</p>

<p>
'Ay, ay, my son.  The pigtails keep very quiet,
and the interpreter chap seems a decent sort&mdash;for
a heathen.'
</p>

<p>
'He can speak tolerable English,' Jack said; 'but
no one can learn what he really is.'
</p>

<p>
'Just their way, lad.  You can never find out
anything about them.  They'll smile and flourish their
flippers, and in the end swindle you with some trick
kept up their sleeves.  All the same, sonny, I suppose
we mustn't condemn this lot before getting good cause.
Keep your weather eye lifting all the time, lad, and
directly anything seems to go amiss with those
chaps, tell the skipper.'
</p>

<p>
Day after day, the barque still sped away on a true
course, and as she got well out into deep blue water
the sunrises and sunsets became of such indescribable
magnificence that even the stolid Chinamen were
compelled to notice them.
</p>

<p>
In the early mornings, long before sunrise, small
cloud-balls of the purest white ranged themselves all
along the western horizon, each apparently separated
by a few inches of the loveliest blue, the azure zenith
remaining unsullied by the slightest trace of gathering
vapour, and in dazzling splendour the huge golden
disc suddenly leaped over the eastern sea-rim.
</p>

<p>
The sunsets, however, were always the most
attractive spectacles.  Through a haze of gauze-like
evaporation, gorgeous combinations of pale blues,
delicate emeralds, pinks, vermilions, and ruddy
golds, ocean and firmament became indistinguishable.
The entire world seemed enveloped in such a flood
of tinted light as neither brush nor pen could hope
to portray.  The barque and its canvas seemed
aflame, while the surging foam beneath the bow
decorated itself in tiny rainbows.
</p>

<p>
Never, surely, had men enjoyed such wonderful
sailing, and still the 'Alert' raced along in grand
style, until, after a fine run of sixteen days, she had
almost reached mid-ocean.  The wind gradually
died away, and with canvas chafing badly against
masts and rigging, she lay wholly becalmed on a sea
unruffled by the faintest cat's-paw.
</p>

<p>
Of course, everyone believed that such a delay to an
otherwise splendid run would only be of short duration,
and at first no notice was taken of the incident.
</p>

<p>
'We'll get a fine breeze directly,' Readyman
observed.  'Should it not come, I'm afraid our
chance of record-breaking is gone.  Anyhow, the
Chinamen have been very quiet, and that is the chief
thing this voyage.'
</p>

<p>
'We had nearly three weeks of it coming out,'
Jack replied.  'I thought I should never get rid of
the prickly heat.'
</p>

<p>
Two weeks of windless inactivity, with the barque
sullenly turning her head toward every point of the
horizon, were followed by another of similar
experience, and limbs ached under the constant bracing of
yards to catch the slightest breath of elusive airs.
Still there was no relief, nor the least prospect of
immediate alteration of the trying weather.  As food
and water had only been shipped for a stated period,
and such delay was not contemplated at that season
of the year, some talk of a reduction of rations was
mooted fore and aft.
</p>

<p>
Against such a procedure the hands, of course,
made no complaint, but when the matter had been
explained to the interpreter, and by him to the
Chinamen down below, they expressed strong
opposition, and much impatience at the length of the
voyage.
</p>

<p>
Captain Thorne promptly took the matter in hand,
collected all his men abaft the stockade, and then
directing the interpreter to call some of the emigrants
on deck he demanded a full explanation of their
grievances.
</p>

<p>
'You no gib mensh allee same food plomised at
Hong Kong,' the burly spokesman replied.  'We no
get 'nough rice.  You allee same cheatee Chinaman.
We no takee less rice, an' wanshee cook it dun b'low.'
</p>

<p>
'You will be no worse off than my own men,' the
skipper said.  'Should this calm run into a month or
six weeks, you'll run a fair chance of having nothing
at all.  I only wish to be on the safe side.  Savvee?'
</p>

<p>
'You cookee no boil rice allee same China.  We
wanshee do it allee same plopper.'
</p>

<p>
'There is not room for you in the galley,' the old
man explained.  'You cannot cook in the 'tween
deck.  When a breeze comes, you shall have plenty
of rice.'
</p>

<p>
To that the spokesman made no reply, and what
with the persuasion of the interpreter and the friendly
demeanour of the captain the murmurers returned
below, and the incident closed.
</p>

<p>
'They told me,' the interpreter said, 'that on coming
here they did not expect to be longer than one week
at sea, and had no idea that San Francisco was much
farther than Shanghai.'
</p>

<p>
'I would take the precaution of securing the large
gratings on all the hatches,' Mr. Sennit said.  'With
them on, we could keep better watch against sudden
surprise, and only allow a few men on deck at one
time.'
</p>

<p>
'Well, I've been thinking of something of that sort
myself,' the skipper replied; 'but just at present I
think we had better let matters stand as they are.
The fellows might make some disturbance about them.
At the same time, Sennit, don't send any of our men
aloft.  They must remain handy for a call, and let
them see that all the rifles in the forecastle are
ready.'
</p>

<p>
Throughout that day the distressing calm continued,
the barometer standing so high and steady that no
immediate change could be anticipated, and on the
following morning orders to reduce all rations fore
and aft were issued.
</p>

<p>
The cook was also enjoined to be particularly
careful of the way in which the rice for the emigrants
was served, since from certain samples of that article
shown by the interpreter, it was evident that the man
had not been as careful in that direction as could have
been desired.
</p>

<p>
However, the Chinamen made no disturbance, and,
so far as outward appearance went, they seemed
disposed to fall in with the new arrangements.  All
hands went about deck softly whistling for a breeze
to end their troubles.  But the outlook still remained
of the same hopeless appearance.  The sea, like a
silvered mirror, flung back in dazzling brilliancy the
powerful rays of an unclouded sun, and with endless
groan of seams and timbers; the barque rolled on the
windless waste of waters.  The situation was fast
becoming more and more serious.  The 'Alert' had
been caught in a tropical entanglement from which
she could neither advance nor retire.
</p>

<p>
Then suddenly the long spell of anxiety was brought
to a close, but in such an unexpected and startling
manner as to almost overwhelm both vessel and crew.
</p>

<p>
At four o'clock one afternoon, Mr. Statten and his
men took over control of the deck.  About half an
hour later, one of the hands directed attention toward
a peculiar appearance just gathering far away on the
port beam.
</p>

<p>
'There might be some wind in it, sir,' he said.
</p>

<p>
Immediately afterwards everyone perceived that it
was a pillar-like cloud, apparently revolving at terrific
speed on its own axis, and also moving down on the
barque at incredible velocity.  That it would
assuredly strike her no one doubted, and intense
excitement immediately prevailed.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Statten sang out to let fly all studding-sail,
royal, and topgallant halyards.  Even the topsails
were lowered, and everything likely to ease the
strain on the masts was done.
</p>

<p>
Captain Thorne, alarmed by the sudden commotion,
rushed on deck, and, seizing the wheel, helped to
place it hard up.  But without wind the barque
would not answer her helm.
</p>

<p>
A moment later there was a sensible movement of
the atmosphere.  It seemed as though the vessel were
being sucked toward the hideous black pillar, then
not more than a cable's length away.  There was an
awful roar of wind, and the impenetrable darkness
became appalling.
</p>

<p>
The 'Alert' was caught by the terrible whirlwind,
and she seemed to be lifted several feet from the
water.  A wild jumble of sea and foam rose up over
and swept the decks fore and aft.  She lay down
almost on her starboard beam-ends.  Everyone hung
fast to belaying-pins or other means of safety,
and in that deafening uproar no voice, or the
least sound of what was taking place, could be
heard.
</p>

<p>
Then, as swiftly as it had come, the dreadful cloud
swept away eastward, and the partially dismantled
vessel lay rocking on a momentarily agitated sea.
From start to finish the whole incident did not occupy
above two minutes, yet in that brief period the 'Alert'
had become almost a wreck.  The foremast, with the
jib-boom and all attached, was gone.  Every shroud
and particle of running gear about that part of the
vessel had been cut as if with an axe, and quarter of
a mile off the wreckage lay on the water.
</p>

<p>
'Are all our men safe, Statten?' were the first
words uttered by the skipper.
</p>

<p>
'I think so, sir,' the mate replied.
</p>

<p>
But from the adjacent wreckage three men, who
had been carried away on it, sang out lustily for
assistance.  They were soon on board again, little
the worse of their extraordinary adventure.
</p>

<p>
A careful examination of the vessel followed.  She
was not making any water, and beyond the loss of
the mast, which had been screwed clean off level with
the deck, and the jib-boom, no other damage was
observed.
</p>

<p>
The more the affair was considered, the more
mysterious did it appear, since not even a rope-yarn
about the mainmast or farther aft had been carried
away.
</p>

<p>
'It struck her obliquely, and so saved the after
sticks,' Captain Thorne said.  'A water-spout would
have sunk her.'
</p>

<p>
'Before I could grip anything,' one of the rescued
men exclaimed, 'I was lifted off my feet.  On looking
upward, the yards and canvas, the latter mostly in
rags, were whizzing round and round at forty knots
an hour.  I thought I would have smothered.
Anyhow, the whirligig suddenly dropped me with the
gear.  There was a tremendous splash.  Then I saw
my two mates.  The next moment I thought I'd
drown, but Billy Holland dragged me on top of the
lower mast.  'Twas the closest shave I ever had.'
</p>

<p>
That was how the first of a coming breeze caught
the vessel.  She immediately sheered alongside the
floating spars, and with right goodwill all hands set
to work getting them on board.  Tackles were rove
off and a derrick rigged.
</p>

<p>
'Bear a hand, now, Sennit,' the old man sang out
'The glass is dropping for wind, and we may have
plenty of it soon.'
</p>

<p>
Assisted by the interpreter, he got some of the
emigrants to help.  Others, however, were not so
disposed, and the hands jeered them.  Before nightfall
all the wreckage had been secured on deck, and
the barque proceeded on her voyage.
</p>

<p>
The light wind of the evening steadily strengthened
throughout the night, and the crew never ceased their
labour of repairing damages.  One of the chief causes
of delay lay in the fact that the 'cap' of the bowsprit,
or the piece of wood through which the jib-boom should
pass, had been broken off; but by the ingenuity of the
carpenter that mishap was speedily rectified.  The
lower mast had also been badly snapped off, but that,
too, was set straight by a tongue and 'step' which
were made on it, the stump still remaining in its place.
</p>

<p>
In the refitting Jack Clewlin had his share, and
gained such experience of that duty that Readyman
himself could not hope to impart by mere verbal
tuition.
</p>

<p>
All the lower and other rigging had to be shortened
and then set up taut.  The upper masts, however,
had received no injury, and with their yards were
soon sent aloft.  The damaged sails were replaced by
others, and within a week scarcely a trace of the late
accident remained.
</p>

<p>
All hands were once more in high spirits, and as
the breeze still held strong and fair, great hopes of
soon reaching San Francisco cheered every mind.
A full daily ration of food was served out fore and aft.
But the brightest anticipations of a speedy
termination of the voyage were doomed to bitter
disappointment.  Within a few days the wind again
failed.  The Chinamen, believing that the food supply
would be reduced, immediately hastened on deck, and
loudly upbraiding the captain for bringing them all
into such a position, stubbornly expressed their
determination to return to Hong Kong.
</p>

<p>
Captain Thorne, who was accompanied by the
interpreter, faced them manfully, and endeavoured
to point out how he himself, and all his crew, were
greatly distressed by the unexpected delays.  At the
same time he gave orders for the watch on deck to
assemble behind the stockade.
</p>

<p>
'Tell them,' he observed to the interpreter, 'that
we cannot return to China.  There is no cause for
anxiety.'
</p>

<p>
'You no allee same one face,' the leader of the
emigrants sang out.  'One day you talkee ploper,
nex' day you cheatee Chinaman, we allee same
starve.  Cookee man him no good.  We cookee
chop-chop allee same China dom b'low.  Savvee?'
</p>

<p>
'And set my ship on fire, eh?' the old man sharply
replied.
</p>

<p>
'No, no, me no fool.  S'pose you go Hong Kong
we likee plenty.'
</p>

<p>
At that point of the argument the interpreter
endeavoured to make matters still clearer to his
countrymen; but, in spite of all explanation and
good temper, the men could not be induced to return
below.
</p>

<p>
Then suddenly the real meaning of the disturbance
was made plain.  A horrible screaming, and piteous
cries for assistance, came aft from the forecastle, where
some of the mutineers were evidently murdering the
watch below.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Sennit shouted on his men to come aft, but to
that order there was no reply.  He then attempted
to open one of the stockade gates, and with assistance
rescue the surprised hands, but Captain Thorne
peremptorily refused to allow such a step to be
taken.
</p>

<p>
That action probably saved the lives of those
behind the barrier.  The Chinamen made a rush at
the galley, where the cook had already secured
himself, and with loaded revolver sold his life as
dearly as he could.  The gallant interpreter, ignoring
all danger, begged the captain to pass him through
one of the gates, and that being done he strove to
pacify the infuriated mob.
</p>

<p>
The appeal failed.  The galley was surrounded and
torn down, the brave cook was killed, but not before
six assailants had been shot down, and his body was
thrown overboard.  The affair passed so rapidly that
there was scarcely time for consideration.  The
moment the cook had disappeared the Chinamen
suddenly turned on their interpreter, and served him
in similar manner.
</p>

<p>
Those abaft the stockade felt assured that their
unfortunate comrades in the forecastle had all been
killed, and that opinion was strengthened by the fact
that no more cries were heard.  The fore part of the
'Alert' was, therefore, in possession of the mutineers.
</p>

<p>
Just as the mob made their first attack on the
stockade one of the watch below was suddenly seen
to climb hand over hand up the fore stay, and on
reaching the top he swung himself to the main
topmast head, from whence he speedily joined his
companions.
</p>

<p>
'All the others in the fo'c's'le are dead, sir!' he
gasped.  'I was asleep overhead, and hid in the bow
till the cut-throats cleared out.'
</p>

<p>
'How did they get to the fo'c's'le?' the skipper
inquired.
</p>

<p>
'Knocked out the fore hatch grating, sir,' the man
replied.  'They've seized all the rifles and ammunition
pouches hanging on the bunk sides.'
</p>

<p>
As fast as Mr. Statten, Jack Clewlin, and the
steward could pass on deck rifles, old muskets,
revolvers, and ammunition, their friends armed
themselves, and, under the direction of Captain
Thorne, took up positions to repel attack.
</p>

<p>
Several of the Chinamen were now seen brandishing
the weapons stolen from the forecastle, and not
a few also carried revolvers, which must have been
concealed in the small boxes brought on board at
Hong Kong.
</p>

<p>
The mutineers, apparently confident of success,
flung themselves on the stockade, and with terrible
yells endeavoured to tear it down.  The barrier,
however, was so strongly constructed that no
impression was made on it, and that seemed to
inflame the mob to further effort.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, the captain used every means to quell
the disturbance without bloodshed, and with upraised
arms endeavoured to address the leader of the
Chinamen.  The effort proved partly successful.
Some of the emigrants seemed inclined to hear him,
and for a few minutes both sides stood looking at
each other, one hundred and thirty desperadoes
menacing a small group of white men, consisting of
Captain Thorne and his two officers, the carpenter,
the steward, with five hands, including Readyman
and Jack Clewlin.
</p>

<p>
'Fight no good,' the skipper sang out.  'S'pose
you allee same go down below, me no shoot.  You
no savvee how to fire gun.  My men savvee plenty.
When wind come you get plenty chop-chop.'
</p>

<p>
'No, no!' the big Chinaman exclaimed.  'You no
speak allee same one face.  To-mollow you say half
chop-chop.  Me takee ship, an' go allee same China.
Savvee?  Me chop you head off now.  Me plenty
gun, an' shoot foreign devil.'
</p>

<p>
'S'pose you fire, me kill you,' the old man replied.
'Give me your guns, and I takee you allee same
San Francisco.'
</p>

<p>
'Me no go dere.  Plenty chop-chop when you
dead.  Savvee?'
</p>

<p>
'You scoundrel, I'll have the lot of you tried at
San Francisco!' Captain Thorne cried.
</p>

<p>
'Let us give the ruffians a volley, and have done
with it!' Mr. Sennit exclaimed, furious at the loss of
his men.  'That fellow is trying to bluff you.'
</p>

<p>
'Very likely,' the old man returned; 'but I'm not
to be caught that way.  I feel our loss as keenly as
anyone, but want to show later on that every possible
means of quelling the outbreak was taken before a
shot was fired.'
</p>

<p>
'You are right, sir,' the mate said.
</p>

<p>
A final appeal to surrender and return below was
howled down by the mob.
</p>

<p>
With fearful cries they flung themselves on the
stockade.  Captain Thorne, in the hope of easing
the pressure on it, ordered some of his men to
thrust between the bars the long spears captured
from the savages in Torres Strait, and although
Mr. Sennit strongly advised the immediate adoption
of sterner measures, the old man would not allow a
shot to be fired.
</p>

<p>
'Let them do that first,' he said.
</p>

<p>
The mutineers, apparently infuriated by the delay,
tugged and wrenched at the iron bars till everything
shook again, but as nothing gave way they began to
discharge their weapons.
</p>

<p>
Only one of the sailors, a man named Clark, was
slightly wounded in the shoulder.  He was advised
to retire to the cabin, yet, despite such persuasion,
the brave fellow refused to leave his post, and tying
a cloth about the injury went on with his duty as
though nothing had happened.  And there he
remained throughout the whole of the desperate
encounter which followed the firing of the first
bullets at those abaft the stockade.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap14"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV
<br /><br />
THE YELLOW PERIL
</h3>

<p>
In spite of all their efforts not much injury was
done to the stockade; but in loud tones the
leader of the mutiny urged on his followers to
yet another attempt to destroy the barrier.  Scores
of strong hands seized and wrenched at it, until the
structure seemed on the point of parting from its
stout bolts, and a fiendish cry of satisfaction arose.
Several shots were also fired at the crew, but no one
was hurt.  Mr. Sennit became alarmed, yet, although
the protection seemed about to collapse, Captain
Thorne would not permit a shot to be discharged.
</p>

<p>
'We must wait a little longer,' he said.  'I think
there is some sign of exhaustion, and they may
become weary of the foolish struggle.'
</p>

<p>
'They'll have the bars about our ears directly,'
the mate replied.  'You are too lenient.'
</p>

<p>
'Perhaps.  I do not wish to give an order that will
prove disastrous to them,' was the calm reply.
</p>

<p>
It was not long before even his cool judgment was
compelled to acknowledge that further forbearance
be taken by the foe as a sign of weakness,
or, perhaps, cowardice, and they were becoming
bolder.
</p>

<p>
At last the order to fire was given.
</p>

<p>
The result proved serious, but a corresponding
volley from the enemy inflicted no injuries among
the sailors, since the Chinamen had slight knowledge
of their weapons, and either could not or would not
face the European fire, and all their bullets, being
discharged over the heads of those in front, flew high
among the after spars and canvas.
</p>

<p>
The tottering stockade was almost torn down.
The leader of the mutiny yelled his delight, and
forcing his way aft he called for a final assault.
His burly form rose head and shoulders above all
others.  The moment he appeared, however, several
rifles took steady aim, but it was the man Walker,
who had given the proof of marksmanship when
lying at the Malay island, that got in the first shot.
In an instant the instigator of all the trouble lay
a lifeless mass among the feet of his misguided
followers.
</p>

<p>
A terrible cry of mingled regret, vengeance, and
savage lust of blood followed the death of the
Chinaman, and the pressure on the stockade
immediately ceased.  Bereft of their leader, the
mutineers became less formidable, and as darkness
quickly succeeded the disappearance of the sun, their
efforts to gain the upper hand diminished.  The
numbers of dead and wounded had reached serious
proportions.
</p>

<p>
The 'cease fire' was called, and Captain Thorne
promptly offered assistance to those who needed it,
also offering to end the fight; yet the infuriated
survivors stubbornly refused to submit, or even
allow one of their wounded to be touched by white
hands.
</p>

<p>
The heavy loss of life was deeply regretted by the
skipper, but he knew that by no other means could
the safety of the vessel and the lives of his men have
been secured.
</p>

<p>
The stolid, unheeding Chinamen made no attempt
to leave the deck.  In the deepening gloom half
their numbers seemed to have fallen, but they still
remained facing the stockade, and only awaited the
cheering voice of some new leader before making a
final attempt to reach their opponents.  Such a
move was, however, not immediately undertaken.
They seemed quite aware that any advance would
certainly add to the heap of bodies lying across the
front of the barrier.
</p>

<p>
Those abaft the latter paced from side to side of
the deck, ready to fire on the slightest provocation,
and eager to avenge the deaths of their unfortunate
comrades surprised in the forecastle.  Indeed, had
it not been for the watchful anxiety of the
captain, not one Chinaman would have survived
that terrible mutiny.
</p>

<p>
It was not long before a serious disagreement
arose among the remaining emigrants.  Many of
them, possibly alarmed by the result of their late
action, separated from their companions, and after
what appeared a long and highly-excited discussion
they suddenly set to work removing the dead and
wounded, but treated all alike.  Within a few minutes
scarcely a trace of what had happened in front of
the stockade remained.  Then the deck was washed
down, and all returned to the bow.
</p>

<p>
Captain Thorne immediately took steps to secure
the almost useless stockade, and during that
operation one hand at a time went to the cabin
for refreshment.
</p>

<p>
Now, almost from the beginning of the desperate
struggle a light breeze, unnoticed by anyone save
the skipper, had set in, and Jack Clewlin was sent
to the wheel.  From that position he had breathlessly
followed the progress of the mutiny, and he was
pleased to see that none of his shipmates, save
Clark, received any injury.  Of course, the wounded
sailor received prompt attention, and soon recovered
his usual health.  Nearly two watches, eight hours,
had passed since the trouble began.  All that while
the 'Alert' had been slipping along before a nice
fair wind.  The loss of nearly half the crew necessitated
an alteration of the course, and Captain Thorne
now determined to steer directly toward the nearest
of the Sandwich Islands, where assistance might
be obtained.  The ill-fated barque, however, never
reached any port.
</p>

<p>
The dead sailors in the forecastle were buried
quietly that night.
</p>

<p>
Another heated argument among the mutineers
presently arose, and about half of them again came
aft, and thrusting their arms between the bars of the
stockade begged for some food.
</p>

<p>
'Not a morsel till you surrender,' the skipper
sternly replied.
</p>

<p>
'We no wanchee fight,' a man replied.  'Noder
Chinaman him no good.  Plenty shoot.  Savvee?'
</p>

<p>
'I think you might let them through the gate,
sir,' Mr. Sennit said.  'They seem to have had
enough of it.'
</p>

<p>
'Not so fast, man,' the captain sang out.  'This
may be some dodge to seize all hands.  Let us find
out what is meant.'
</p>

<p>
The applicants were suddenly assailed by the
still mutinous portion of their countrymen, and a
desperate encounter ensued.  Captain Thorne would
not interfere, but after a prolonged struggle the
attackers were finally defeated and driven to the
'tween deck.  Then hastening to the stockade those
left on deck again asked for help, and promised to
behave well in future.
</p>

<p>
'I now believe they are sincere,' the captain said.
'Let them pass through, Sennit.'
</p>

<p>
When grouped at the stern and supplied with
biscuit and water the men expressed their gratitude.
Some of them made extraordinary signs, apparently
directed toward those down below, and the surrender
proved genuine.
</p>

<p>
The men numbered thirty-eight all told, and
seemed surprised by the kindness bestowed.  They
continued to direct attention to the 'tween deck, and
had the captain correctly understood what was
intended, much subsequent trouble might have been
avoided.  He could not be expected to waste more
time over such considerations, and no one took any
notice of the well-intentioned warnings.
</p>

<p>
Armed sentinels were placed over each of the
hatchways.  Then the remaining hands set to
work clearing up the forecastle, where everything
movable had been knocked about and the sea-chests
ransacked, and it even appeared that some
attempt had been made to set the place on fire.
</p>

<p>
All that while no sound of voice or footstep could
be heard in the 'tween deck, and it was surmised
that all the men there had gone to sleep.  The
silence, when subsequently recalled, proved beyond
doubt that the mutinous Chinamen were quite
differently engaged.
</p>

<p>
The forecastle having been set straight, Mr. Sennit
turned his attention to setting up another galley;
and when that had been arranged, one of the hands
helped the steward to get the fire lit and some coffee
served out.
</p>

<p>
At last Jack Clewlin's long spell at the wheel
ended, and in the cabin he found Captain Thorne
who commended his conduct, and ordered a
substantial supper.
</p>

<p>
For some time nothing of importance was
noted, but just after four o'clock that morning a
strong smell of smoke became noticeable fore and
aft, and instantly aroused much alarm among the
crew.
</p>

<p>
'They are firing the barque!' Captain Thorne
exclaimed, in great anxiety.  'Arm yourselves, all
hands, and follow me!'
</p>

<p>
As he and Mr. Sennit stepped on the main 'tween-deck
ladder it gave way under the strain, and both
men were precipitated into the midst of a howling
mob below.
</p>

<p>
By the use of their revolvers, however, both men
succeeded in keeping the enemy at bay, while
without hesitation the crew leaped after their leaders,
and with cutlass and rifle speedily cleared a space
round the endangered officers.
</p>

<p>
By that time the smoke in the hold had become
so dense that it was impossible to follow the
mutineers, but by repeated volleys the latter became
so cowed that no further annoyance came from that
quarter.  The crew promptly endeavoured to discover
the seat of the fire.  That it had originated
somewhere in the bow there was no doubt; yet to reach
that place became almost impossible, so thick were
the volumes of smoke filling the 'tween deck, and all
hands were consequently compelled to return to the
open.
</p>

<p>
The main hatch ladder, which had been cut from
its fastenings by the mutineers, was speedily
reshipped in its place, and such of the emigrants as
could be found were dragged on deck, while the fore
hatch grating was removed.  The head pump was
rigged and its hose attached, and then lowered into
the 'tween deck.
</p>

<p>
Both mates, with large oakum respirators fastened
over their mouths and nostrils, descended into the
hold, and presently reported that the outbreak had
been started in the bo's'n's locker, immediately
beneath the forecastle, which was stocked with bales
of rope, oakum, spun-yarn, old canvas, and other
highly-inflammable gear.
</p>

<p>
As though such material was not considered
sufficiently dangerous, the desperate-minded
Chinamen had removed all the light wood from their own
bunks, and forcing the bulkhead had thrown the
pieces on the fire.
</p>

<p>
Without delay a copious stream of water was
directed on the flames.  The conflagration had now
become very dangerous.  The smoke was so suffocating,
that in spite of all their gallantry both
officers were compelled to retire, and when hauled on
deck fell exhausted.  Their places were, however,
immediately filled by others, while every available
emigrant was also pressed into the service, and by
means of buckets an endless stream of water was
added to that pouring through the hose.
</p>

<p>
To give them their due, the Chinamen, knowing
full well that by their extra labour the vessel could
alone be saved, and that if anything happened to her
their chances of reaching San Francisco would be
slight, worked splendidly, and did everything in their
power to carry out the orders of the captain.
</p>

<p>
Hour after hour, without a moment's cessation; all
hands struggled desperately to subdue the flames,
many men being constantly overcome by heat and
smoke; yet no sooner had they recovered the effects
of semi-suffocation and exhaustion than each again
tackled the outbreak with determination.
</p>

<p>
In spite of their heroism, however, it was no easy
matter to cope with such an outbreak.  Under
ordinary conditions the locker was not readily reached,
and for many hours it seemed that all the water poured
on the fire had no effect, while everyone felt that such
a serious attack on the bow of the barque would
render it difficult to resist the outward pressure of
water.
</p>

<p>
Although the 'well' was constantly sounded, no
great quantity of water had as yet leaked through
the sides, showing that they were still sound.
</p>

<p>
The immense volumes of smoke rolling from the
hold seemed to become less dense; but Captain
Thorne, wishing to be prepared for any emergency,
ordered Readyman, Jack Clewlin, and the steward
to clear away and provision both quarter boats.
</p>

<p>
All that morning, and throughout the rest of the
day, the desperate battle continued without cessation.
Somewhere about five o'clock in the evening
unmistakable proof that the fire had been subdued
sent a thrill of joyous satisfaction fore and aft.
</p>

<br />
ALL THAT DAY THE DESPERATE BATTLE CONTINUED WITHOUT CESSATION.  <br />
See page 176.
</p>

<p>
'We've succeeded, sir,' Mr. Sennit exclaimed on
coming from below, his beard scorched and face and
hands blackened; 'but I'm much afraid that the injury
to the bow is almost irreparable.  In fact, captain,
it seems to have been nearly burned through.'
</p>

<p>
'I am not surprised,' the old man replied; 'if we
can only succeed in getting her ashore on the nearest
island, we may consider ourselves more than fortunate.
Could any repairs be done so that she might remain
afloat even for a few days?'
</p>

<p>
'Well, at present, sir,' the mate returned, 'I should
not like to touch a single rib or timber, they seem so
badly burned; yet if we can manage to lay some
gear against them, so as to resist the outward
pressure, she might just succeed in getting on the
coral.'
</p>

<p>
'Let go the royal and top-gallant halyards fore
and aft,' the skipper ordered.  'Lay aloft there, men,
and stow the canvas.  That will at least lessen the
strain.'
</p>

<p>
When that work was completed the men tackled
the pumps, and soon discovered that the barque was
beginning to leak badly, since the fierce heat of the
fire had melted all the pitch in the bow seams, and
probably also destroyed most of the oakum caulking.
</p>

<p>
The available Chinamen were immediately divided
into two watches, and in regular relief took their share
of work at the pumps, and the crew were allowed
some hours of repose after their late arduous labour.
</p>

<p>
So, under her topsails, fore and maincourses,
spanker and head canvas, the 'Alert' stood away for
the nearest island, which was only one hundred and
fifty miles off.  Most fortunately the breeze held
fairly strong and steady, but without her upper
canvas or even studding-sails to help the rate of
sailing was slow, and never exceeded four knots an
hour.
</p>

<p>
Captain Thorne was very anxious throughout those
trying times, yet as soon as the hands had had some
sleep and good meals, they promptly set to work
getting the long-boat over the side.  Although at
first she leaked even worse than the barque, a few
hours in the water closed the seams, and she
subsequently proved of considerable use.
</p>

<p>
The quarter-boats were also ready for lowering at a
moment's notice, and as the pumps still managed to
keep down the flow of the sea into the hold everyone
believed that the badly-damaged barque would
continue to remain afloat.
</p>

<p>
With the disappearance of the smoke from the
'tween deck some of the hands were sent there, to
discover what had become of the Chinamen who
made such a dastardly attempt to kill the captain
and Mr. Sennit, and in a heap right aft all of them
were found suffocated.
</p>

<p>
Fifteen of them thus suffered death for participation
in the mutiny, and from what their countrymen
stated there could be no doubt that they were the
murderers of the whites in the forecastle, and the
chief instigators of the whole lamentable affair.
</p>

<p>
During that first night under reduced sail the
'Alert' leaked so badly that even a constant working
of the pumps could not abate the rise of water in
the well, and much anxiety was consequently aroused.
</p>

<p>
'I think it is owing to the stronger breeze,' the
old man sang out.  'Haul up and stow the mainsail.'
</p>

<p>
That was speedily accomplished, and, sure enough,
the inflow immediately decreased.
</p>

<p>
'At daylight we must endeavour to strengthen
the bow either inside or out,' the captain added.
'Otherwise I don't see how we can reach any island.'
</p>

<p>
Throughout that night matters remained somewhat
hopeful, and as the vessel sailed very slowly the
water below was kept under control.
</p>

<p>
An inspection of the damaged bow next morning
disclosed such serious defects that Captain Thorne
could not conceal his anxiety.
</p>

<p>
'It is worse than I had supposed,' he exclaimed.
'The entire bow seems almost gone.  Clewlin!' he
added, 'run on deck and tell Mr. Statten to haul
down and stow the whole of the head canvas.  We
must use the utmost caution.'
</p>

<p>
In several places the planking had been three
parts eaten away, some of the ribs were burned
right through, the forecastle deck overhead was
gone, and but for the outer copper sheathing it was
certain that the 'Alert' could not have remained two
hours above water.
</p>

<p>
'I would abandon her now,' the skipper said, 'had
it not been my desire to save all the stores.  The
island we are shaping for is, I believe, uninhabited,
and how long we may be compelled to remain there
before assistance arrives depends on luck!  There are
the Chinamen to feed, and so we must endeavour to
put her on the coral.'
</p>

<p>
'A thrummed sail secured outside the bow might
stop the leak, sir,' Mr. Sennit observed.
</p>

<p>
'Yes, that may be tried,' the old man replied;
'but the bow is so seriously injured that I'm afraid
nothing can be of much use.'
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XV
<br /><br />
THE 'ALERT'S' LAST BERTH
</h3>

<p>
'What is a thrummed sail, Readyman?' Jack
inquired.
</p>

<p>
'Well, my son,' the quarter-master explained,
'the selected piece of canvas is worked into narrow
pleats, and those are pierced with holes and filled
by short ends of teazed oakum.  In other words,
it is a big mat placed against the injured spot,
so that the material can work into the seams from
outside.  Our metal sheathing is nearly awash, and
unless it has got strained by fire the mat won't be
of much use.'
</p>

<p>
All the same, it was placed in position, and the
water casks in the forehold were shifted farther aft,
so as to raise the bow slightly above the surface of
the sea.
</p>

<p>
One great advantage always remained with them,
the sea kept perfectly smooth and the wind
moderate.  Of course, the pumps were always on the
move, and the Chinamen worked with a will.
</p>

<p>
After an anxious four days Jack Clewlin from aloft
sang out, 'Land, O!'
</p>

<p>
It presently became visible from the deck, and
the old man decided to run to leeward.
</p>

<p>
It was a small but lofty island, perhaps twenty
miles long by about eight or ten miles across, and
it seemed to be covered with thickly-growing timber
and dense undergrowth.  The coast-line was bold
and steep, but no reefs could be seen.
</p>

<p>
Within a couple of hours the 'Alert' had drawn
well abreast of a precipitous headland, and was still
striving to pass it, when suddenly everything aloft
was taken flat aback by baffling winds from the
shore.  The sudden strain thus cast on all the head
stays proved more than the good old barque could
resist, and in a moment large quantities of water
poured into the hold.
</p>

<p>
'She's done for, sir!' Mr. Sennit shouted from the
forecastle-head.  'The bow has almost caved in.'
</p>

<p>
Captain Thorne remained perfectly calm.
</p>

<p>
'All hands loose everything,' he sang out.  'Get
the Chinamen at the pumps.  Bear a hand!  Set
the stu'n's'ls for'a'd.  Carpenter and steward stand
by to lower quarter-boats.  We'll put her hard and
fast yet, Sennit.'
</p>

<p>
The men raced aloft faster than ever in their lives.
The Chinamen worked the pumps for all they were
worth.  Every stitch of canvas was set in less than
ten minutes, and passing the point the steadily
settling vessel ran toward a clear and level bit of
sandy beach under her lee, which, however, she never
reached.
</p>

<p>
The vessel was driven direct for a spot where she
might rest in safety, and she certainly did her best
to reach it.  When some attention could be directed
shoreward it was seen that she had entered a spacious
bay, about four miles across, and deep water seemed
to run right up to the sandy beach.  From the latter
she was still some distance away, and, of course,
as the hull was forced deeper in the water the more
did the leakage increase.  At last the chain-plates
were awash, and it became a matter of doubt if the
shore could be reached.
</p>

<p>
'I don't think she'll do it, lad,' Readyman observed
to his young friend.  'Anyhow, my son, we may not
have far to swim.  You must remain close to me, and
we'll see it&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
A sudden striking of the hull on submerged rocks
almost capsized Jack and his protector.  The damaged
foremast, with all attached, went over the bow.
Mr. Sennit was pitched clean off the forecastle-head into
the water, and thus was undoubtedly saved from
being crushed to death beneath the falling spars.
Most of the after masts were also snapped off by the
force of the blow, but no one was injured.  The hull
was lifted clear of obstruction, and with a long
downward glide finally took the ground in three
fathoms of water.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Sennit was immediately assisted on board,
none the worse of his unexpected dip, and Captain
Thorne congratulated him on his fortunate escape.
</p>

<p>
The 'Alert,' with slight 'list' or inclination to port,
was hard and fast fore and aft.  Readyman and
Jack Clewlin had no necessity to swim ashore.  The
main deck of the wreck remained clear of the water,
and no inconvenience was occasioned to anyone on
board.
</p>

<p>
'Well done, old girl!' the quarter-master exclaimed.
'You're fixed now, and did us a real good turn.'
</p>

<p>
'But it is hard lines, after being together so long,'
Jack said.
</p>

<p>
'We may not part company yet,' Readyman added.
'I'd sooner live here than ashore.  The old man
managed that last scoot in a surprising way, Master
Jack.  Many another would have lost his head, and
smothered all hands.  I never saw a neater bit of
seamanship.  Part company?  Well, sonny, when we
lose sight of this island, I reckon it will be about
time to talk of that, but not before.  How can
anyone tell that this place isn't swarming with
niggers ready to bake us for breakfast?  I'll stick to
the old craft yet.'
</p>

<p>
'Do you know, Readyman, that we are just two
years out?'
</p>

<p>
'Ay, ay, and when leaving Stonewell you or the
dad never expected that through following the
skipper you'd see so many parts of the world, and
in the end become a second Robinson Crusoe, so to
speak.'
</p>

<p>
'That's true,' Jack said; 'but now that I have been
shipwrecked it does not feel half so exciting or
splendid as reading of such things in a book.  Indeed,
Readyman, if my father could only know that I am
alive and well, I should feel quite contented.'
</p>

<p>
'Well, lad, I don't see there's any use in looking at
the affair like that.  We might be rescued to-morrow,
for all that any of us can tell.  Even supposing we
have to bunk it out here for a spell, it might just as
well be done with a light as a heavy heart.  Meeting
trouble half-way ain't my motto at all; keep your
heart up, sonny, and we'll pull through all right.'
</p>

<p>
As a matter of fact, Jack was not greatly distressed
by the loss of the barque.  What had impressed him
much more seriously was the terrible end of the men
with whom he had been so long associated, and
whose cold-blooded murders had made such a lasting
impression on his mind, since among a small body of
men, cooped up together on board ship, the loss of a
single life is keenly regretted long after his belongings
have been put up to auction.
</p>

<p>
An examination of the wreck showed that the sea
did not quite reach the deck, and as it remained dry
and cool the Chinamen were housed forward, and as
the forecastle had been almost destroyed by the fire the
crew was permitted to live aft.  None of the hands
seemed to think the position worthy of much remark,
and settled down comfortably in their new quarters,
as though nothing particularly exciting had occurred.
</p>

<p>
The long-boat, which was towing astern when the
barque took the ground, received no injury, and as
she was in good condition all necessary stores could
be speedily removed.  The two quarter-boats were
also lowered and secured alongside.
</p>

<p>
After supper, lots were drawn for the night watching,
and about eight o'clock the others turned in.
</p>

<p>
Next morning the work of salving the stores
began.  The three boats were in constant movement
between the wreck and the beach, while under the
orders of Mr. Statten the Chinamen set to work
erecting tents, by means of the spars and sails
landed.
</p>

<p>
'We dare not trust the old barque,' Captain Thorne
said.  'If a gale from the westward arose, she would
be soon broken up.'
</p>

<p>
Jack was placed in charge of one boat, and for
some days he was busily employed.
</p>

<p>
All the rifles and ammunition were sent ashore,
even before any of the provisions, for although the
island appeared uninhabited, the skipper deemed it
advisable to be prepared for all contingencies, until a
thorough investigation proved that no anxiety need
be entertained.
</p>

<p>
When the second mate had selected a good
camping-ground he and the emigrants soon rigged
up very respectable tents, the Chinamen being
accommodated in one set apart for their exclusive
use.
</p>

<p>
The stores that were stowed in the cabin of the
barque were in good condition; but most unfortunately
all the beef and pork casks had been so securely
stowed in the hold that they could neither float to
the surface nor be reached by the crew.  On the
other hand, the two 'harness-casks,' in which a
fortnight's supply of meat was kept on deck,
happened to be full, and they were put ashore.  The
big water-tank had not been injured by the grounding
of the vessel, and it was three parts full.  There was
also a spring of excellent drinking water discovered
on the island.
</p>

<p>
For about a week Captain Thorne and a few men
remained on the wreck, but the others always slept in
the tents ashore.
</p>

<p>
Bright and early next morning all hands were
astir.  The fires were replenished, and kettles were
soon 'singing' away in merry tune; and as the 'Alert'
could no longer be set on fire the Chinamen were
allowed to cook their own food, and right well they
did it, too.  They never made the slightest disturbance,
and apparently took the whole affair as a big relief
from the monotony of life afloat, nor did any of
them express the least dislike to detention on the
lonely island.
</p>

<p>
The labour of salvage continued until everything
worth removal had been sent ashore, and only the
hull and lower masts of the 'Alert' remained above
water.  Then Captain Thorne took up his residence
among his men, and a survey of the island was arranged.
</p>

<p>
'I shall take a few men with me and work across
country,' he said.  'You might take the long-boat,
Sennit, and by keeping along the shore endeavour to
join me on the opposite side, and thus discover if
there are natives about.  I have no accurate
knowledge of the place.'
</p>

<p>
'Ay, ay, sir,' the mate replied.  'I do not think
you should travel unarmed.'
</p>

<p>
'Of course not,' the old man returned; 'there may
be cannibals watching us now.  We must strive to
support each other if attacked.'
</p>

<p>
Having selected their men both leaders set off on
their separate adventures.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Statten, Readyman, Jack Clewlin, and two of
the crew remained behind to look after the camp
and the Chinamen.
</p>

<p>
After dinner, and with the consent of the second
mate, Readyman and his young friend set out on an
expedition in search of fresh water.  They took an
opposite course to that of the skipper, and kept a
good lookout for natives.  Both carried rifles and
ammunition.  It was not long before Jack saw
something like a path, apparently made by natives,
trending off through the timber and scrub toward
the centre of the island.  He immediately warned
his companion.
</p>

<p>
'There are people here, after all,' he said.  'Let us
tell Mr. Statten.'
</p>

<p>
'Hold hard, sonny,' Readyman exclaimed.  'No
need for alarm before you're sure that the danger
does exist.  Examine the marks closer, lad.  Do you
see anything at all resembling a human footprint?'
</p>

<p>
Jack stooped lower and examined the trail.
</p>

<p>
'No,' he said.  'There certainly is no appearance
of such marks.  Who made the track, Readyman?'
</p>

<p>
'That's exactly what I want you to find out for
yourself.  Suppose you had been cast ashore without
shipmates, and had to discover everything for future
guidance?  Use your eyes, lad.'
</p>

<p>
Here and there Jack discovered that, on looking
still closer at the trail, it seemed to be recently
disturbed.  Many little pieces of compressed and
decaying leaves looked as if they had been just cut
asunder, and the disturbed earth seemed freshly
trodden.  Then he perceived among the leaves what
looked like a long coarse hair.  A few yards farther
along the track he reached a circular clearance of the
short scrub, while numerous marks showed the recent
presence of many four-footed and cloven-hoofed
animals.
</p>

<p>
'Did you ever see anything like them before?'
the quarter-master inquired.
</p>

<p>
'Cows' feet,' Jack said; 'but these are much
smaller.'
</p>

<p>
'What's that hair you picked up?'
</p>

<p>
A swift gleam of intelligence was followed by a
hearty laugh.
</p>

<p>
'I know, I know!' Jack cried.  'This hair is a
bristle, and the marks have been made by wild pigs.
</p>

<p>
'Exactly, lad; and if I'm not much mistaken
they've had a big fight amongst themselves
hereabouts.'
</p>

<p>
'Let us try to shoot some of them, Readyman.'
</p>

<p>
'I'd like to, my son, but don't forget that the
boars are always savage, and regular demons to fight.
Let me go first.'
</p>

<p>
In silence, and with great caution against sudden
attack by cannibals, both friends continued to follow
the track that led them deeper and deeper into the
forest.  The light still remained fairly good, while
the track held an upward course.  At last they came
suddenly on a great wall of rock rising almost
perpendicularly before them.  At the same moment
Readyman pulled up so abruptly that Jack, walking
close behind, stumbled against him.
</p>

<p>
Without speaking the quarter-master pointed
toward a spot at the base of the cliff, and following
the direction Jack immediately perceived a large
number of small pigs fast asleep in their comfortable
quarters, apparently unaware of impending danger.
</p>

<p>
'Stand behind a tree, and take your choice of a
good fat one,' Readyman whispered.  'Mind you don't
waste a shot.  I'll get under cover also, and see if
we can bring home a couple of good porkers.  Should
you see a boar look wild, mind you get out of his road
as quickly as possible.  If I'm attacked, I'll shin up
one of the trees.'
</p>

<p>
Each sportsman took his chosen position.  The
happily snoring pigs never stirred until suddenly a
stronger whiff of wind from Jack's direction set a
savage-looking but somewhat diminutive boar on its
feet.  A sharp squeal of warning aroused the rest of
the animals.  The boar snorted angrily, and with
head bent close to the ground flew directly toward
the tree behind which Jack stood, with rifle ready to
let fly as soon as he felt certain of hitting the animal.
All that while some thirty or forty pigs of various
sizes and ages stood motionless, awaiting the result
of their leader's onslaught.
</p>

<p>
From behind one tree a deafening noise arose, a
cloud of smoke partly obscured the outlook, but before
it had time to clear off a similar noise came from
another tree.  One of their fattest and most cheery
comrades lay stiff in their midst, while the leader, in
whom the utmost confidence had always been placed,
limped badly on three legs, and from another blood
flowed.  Nevertheless, he was still full of fight, and
made desperate attempts to inflict serious if not fatal
injuries on Jack Clewlin.  Round the foot of the tree
Jack dodged his deadly foe, and on one occasion he
got in a stunning blow of the rifle stock on the hard
head of the boar.  The next moment he was beyond
reach of the sharp and gleaming tusks, which would
have ripped up his leg like paper; but the gun had
been dropped.
</p>

<p>
All that while Readyman was waiting his opportunity
to deal a fatal blow, and when he fired the
infuriated pig dropped dead without a squeal.
</p>

<p>
'Climb down, my son,' the quarter-master
whispered.  'You got well out of that scrape.  Let
us have another shot at the crowd before they clear
out.'
</p>

<p>
The pigs, apparently fascinated, remained motionless.
Jack speedily recovered, and re-charged his rifle,
and within a couple of seconds as many more pigs fell
to the shots of the sportsmen.  Thus brought to a
sense of their own imminent danger, the remaining
animals dashed off into the thick woods and
disappeared.
</p>

<p>
With their spoils of the fight both men returned
to camp.  Mr. Statten had heard the firing, yet felt
that as no one sang out for assistance nothing need
be feared; but he mustered all the Chinamen, and
made ready to repel a possible native attack.
</p>

<p>
All hands were agreeably surprised by the arrival
of so much fresh food, and with the tough old boar,
as their share of the meat the pigtails hastened back
to their quarters to enjoy a good meal.
</p>

<p>
It was almost dark before Mr. Sennit with the
long-boat returned to camp; but of Captain Thorne
and his party no information was forthcoming.
</p>

<p>
'I've seen nothing of them all day,' the mate said.
'Perhaps there are natives on the island,'
Mr. Statten observed.  'The captain may have been
lured into some trap.'
</p>

<p>
'Well, I thought he had returned,' the mate replied.
'We cannot leave him adrift all night.  Come along,
some of you, and let us discover the truth.  Don't
forget your guns, boys.'
</p>

<p>
Everyone in camp wished to join him, but
taking Readyman, Jack Clewlin, and one hand, he
immediately set out on the trail of the missing men.
By the time that they had covered a quarter of a mile
the darkness rendered progress difficult.  In spite
of that, however, Mr. Sennit led the way, and
the almost invisible track began to ascend.  Still
advancing, they came out suddenly on the summit of
a high ridge, and in the opposite valley heard the
discharge of a rifle.
</p>

<p>
'That comes from the captain!' Mr. Sennit
exclaimed.  'We'll soon find out what may be
wrong.'
</p>

<p>
He discharged his piece to announce the proximity
of friends, and then casting about for some trace of
the path, discovered that it took a sharp easterly
turn, and finally went downward over the ridge.
</p>

<p>
'It seems almost madness to follow it in the dark,'
the mate said.  'Anyhow, where they went safely we
can chance a slight fall.  Let us rope ourselves
together, and Clewlin, being the lightest, must take
the lead.'
</p>

<p>
Down they went without accident, and within
half an hour Captain Thorne and his party were
found.
</p>

<p>
'One of my men has broken his leg,' the skipper
explained.  'We have had to carry him all the
afternoon.'
</p>

<p>
'We only heard your signal after reaching the top
of the hill, sir,' Mr. Sennit said.
</p>

<p>
'Did you discover anything in the long-boat,
Sennit?'
</p>

<p>
'No, sir.  The place seems uninhabited.'
</p>

<p>
'Except for wild pigs, of which there are many,'
Captain Thorne returned.  'From certain signs,
however, I'm led to think that not long ago the
place must have been somewhat thickly dotted with
villages.  They have all been burned.'
</p>

<p>
'Probably by native enemies, sir,' the mate said.
</p>

<p>
'No, Sennit, but by "black-birders" who have
stolen the people.'
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVI
<br /><br />
'ALL HANDS ON DECK!'
</h3>

<p>
The night proved so dark and the track so
difficult to follow, that, hampered by the
injured seaman, the captain and his party
found the return no easy matter.  Everyone, however,
worked so cheerfully that just as dawn showed
eastward next morning the camp was reached without
further adventure or accident.
</p>

<p>
After breakfast the captain called a general
muster before his tent, and explained his opinions on
the situation.
</p>

<p>
'The island is uninhabited,' he said.  'We must
try to leave it as soon as possible.  The stock of
provisions cannot last beyond a month, and as I
have the Chinamen to feed we must get them to
Honolulu.  Our three boats are in good condition,
and might easily make the trip.'
</p>

<p>
'I could reach there in the long-boat, sir,'
Mr. Sennit observed, 'and hire a larger craft to take
you off.'
</p>

<p>
'Well, of course that could be done,' the skipper
replied; 'but I believe that by a little close stowage
all hands might sail together.  Such a course would
save a lot of time, trouble, and expense, to say nothing
of being able to stick together for assistance, should
foul weather set in.'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, that would be the best way out of the fix,'
the mate said; 'and I have no doubt we'll do it, too.'
</p>

<p>
The boats were immediately got ready for service.
Everyone became anxious that a start southward
should be made.  The Chinamen were informed of
what was about to take place, and they made no
objection.
</p>

<p>
On the morning of the contemplated departure,
however, a change of weather set in, and within a
few hours a tremendous gale and high sea were
sweeping directly into the bay.  Captain Thorne
immediately gave orders for the boats to be hauled
above high-water mark; but, although the two
smaller ones were quickly unloaded and saved, the
heavy long-boat was not so easily handled.
</p>

<p>
'All hands on deck!' the skipper shouted, through
blinding rain, stinging spume, and screaming wind,
'Save the stores!'
</p>

<p>
So heavy was the surf on the beach that scarcely
anything in the big boat was secured, and she was
finally tossed ashore in a hopelessly shattered condition.
</p>

<p>
All the tents were blown down.  Much of the
stores there deposited were also carried away into
the woods, and the Chinamen became so frightened
that all of them disappeared, and were subsequently
discovered two miles inland.
</p>

<p>
The storm increased with such rapidity that in
spite of their most active efforts many men were
blown off their feet.  The immense waves presently
caught and broke up the quarter-boats, and the
beach was strewn with wreckage.
</p>

<p>
For some hours the outlook remained so thick
that nothing of the 'Alert' could be seen; but
some of her spars were noticed coming ashore.
</p>

<p>
As nothing more could be done along the beach
Captain Thorne turned his attention toward saving
as much of the tent gear as was possible, and most
of it was secured.
</p>

<p>
Toward the evening the storm abated, and a
sudden clearance of the atmosphere was immediately
followed by the general cry, 'The barque's gone!'  Of
her not a trace, save the shattered wreckage
ebbing and flowing with every 'send' of the high
sea, remained, and all hands perceived that no hope
of leaving the island by their own efforts was
possible.
</p>

<p>
'Well, we're in God's hands!' the captain said.
'Had we left here and been caught outside in the
storm, none could have lived two hours.  Let us be
thankful for that mercy.'
</p>

<p>
So rapidly did the wind fall that before sundown
two tents were rigged up amongst the trees near the
beach, a fire was lighted, a kettle was found, and
filled with water taken from a cask which the gale
could only shift a few yards, and all hands settled
down for the night.
</p>

<p>
Next morning not a trace of the late trouble
appeared.  Indeed, the sun shone with increased
brilliancy, and the clearness of the atmosphere was
wonderful.
</p>

<p>
A good fire soon had the kettle steaming cheerily
for breakfast, while, 'smiling all over their pigtail faces,'
as Readyman said, two of the missing Chinamen
strolled into camp seeking food.
</p>

<p>
'What you do with pigee me give yesterday?'
Mr. Statten inquired.  'S'pose you go catchee
him.'
</p>

<p>
'Win' allee same blow him San Francisco,' the
man replied.  'Him no good.  Wanchee too muchee
chow-chow.  Savvee?'
</p>

<p>
Captain Thorne laughed very heartily.  'They
can't have enjoyed that old boar,' he said.  'Give
them some bread, steward.'
</p>

<p>
The fellows went off smiling more serenely than
ever, and the remainder of their companions soon
trotted in for further supplies.
</p>

<p>
'See here, Sennit,' the old man observed, 'when on
my tramp we saw several apparently cultivated
patches of ground.  There may be things there
worth having, as the owners did not turn up.  These
Chinamen cause me much anxiety.  I must land
them in California.'
</p>

<p>
'I'll take a couple of hands and try to cross the
island,' the mate replied.  'There's no time to lose.'
</p>

<p>
Three of the hands, with Readyman and Jack
Clewlin, immediately volunteered for service.  Each
of them was supplied with a rifle and ammunition
and rations sufficient for three days.  Headed by
the mate, all set off on the expedition, and good
progress was made.
</p>

<p>
They followed the old track, and soon perceived
that some easier route than that precipitous descent
into the opposite valley must be found, as otherwise
they would lose much valuable time in getting the
crops up the rocks and into camp.
</p>

<p>
'We must separate and find another path,' the
mate said.  'Should any of you discover one, fire
your rifle.'
</p>

<p>
'Ay, ay, sir.'
</p>

<p>
Jack and Readyman went off together.  They had
some difficulty in forcing a passage through the
thick undergrowth, and the quarter-master presently
declared that no road in that direction would be
found.  'I thought the pigs might have given us a
clue, lad,' he said; 'but they have never strolled up
here.'
</p>

<p>
Just then Jack, who was in advance, suddenly
reached a sharp bend of the ridge, and emerged on
a good clearance.  From there the ground began to
fall away gently toward the valley, and in an instant
his eye caught slight of a pig-track.
</p>

<p>
'Then we've been the first to make a discovery!'
Readyman exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
He immediately discharged his rifle, and the other
men speedily arrived.  The track was followed, and,
after about a mile of steady tramping in single
file, all hands walked straight into the midst of
several rudely constructed huts that stood at
the foot of a great tree; but no natives could be
seen.
</p>

<p>
'They've only just cleared out,' Readyman said.
'Look!  The fires are still alight.'
</p>

<p>
'Keep quiet,' Mr. Sennit whispered.  'The
unfortunate people probably mistake us for
"blackbirders."  Captain Thorne's suggestion was correct.
The place has been raided by scoundrels who carry
off the men for trade.'
</p>

<p>
Close by a large patch of ground was well cultivated,
and many large pumpkins, yams, and sweet potatoes
were flourishing.  Suddenly Jack saw a woman
approaching, and held up his arms, as a sign that
nothing need be feared.  Then many other females,
some of them accompanied by children, approached
the huts; but not one man appeared.  By that time
the white party had hidden their weapons away, and
as the mate made friendly signs the women slowly
returned to their homes.
</p>

<p>
Much chattering among the half-frightened, half
friendly-disposed women ensued; but in a wonderful
manner Mr. Sennit explained the real nature of his
visit, and how his vessel had been wrecked on the
island.
</p>

<p>
Considerable satisfaction was immediately apparent
among the people, and without hesitation they led
him toward another and until then unseen patch of
cultivated ground, which they signified he could
make use of.
</p>

<p>
With deep lamentations they also indicated that
quite recently a small vessel had arrived on the coast,
and after some friendly palaver suddenly seized all
the men, and with them left the island.  Indeed, it
soon became clear that such practices had been
common of late, and that in that way the beautiful
spot had been denuded of all its able-bodied
inhabitants.
</p>

<p>
A good stock of vegetables was secured for the
camp; but when the white men attempted to load
themselves up for the return journey the women
immediately volunteered their services, and dividing
the loads into somewhat smaller quantities set out to
guide the visitors home.
</p>

<p>
Their route differed considerably from that taken
by the mate; for a while it seemed as though the
party were pursuing a circuitous road, but on being
assured that all was correct the mate ceased his
advice, and in the end he was conducted straight back
to camp in much less time than could have been
deemed possible.
</p>

<p>
'Well, well, Sennit,' the old man sang out, 'you've
been making hay while the sun shone, and no
mistake.'
</p>

<p>
'Hay, sir!' the mate cried, 'it's good pumpkin,
yams, and sweet spuds, this time.  There is any
amount of fruit as well, but I didn't like to be too
greedy first time of asking.'
</p>

<p>
'Where did you find the women?'
</p>

<p>
'Quite by accident.  All their men-folk have been
carried off by some ruffianly "black-birders."'
</p>

<p>
The women feared only the Chinamen; and when
returning home each was given a couple of biscuits.
</p>

<p>
On the following day several women returned with
quantities of excellent vegetables and fruit, for which
they eagerly accepted ship bread; and as the meat
supply in camp was running short Captain Thorne
signified his needs of more.
</p>

<p>
The women immediately offered to become guides
for a shooting party, and under their directions
Mr. Sennit and five hands set off on the trail.
</p>

<p>
The accurate knowledge of the animals' habits
possessed by the natives proved highly advantageous,
and the expedition was also fruitful of results.
</p>

<p>
On reaching a certain spot about four miles from
the camp, all the white men were advised to remain
in hiding, and keep a good lookout.  Then the
women disappeared.
</p>

<p>
An hour of inactivity ensued.  Then suddenly a
faint rustling among the scrub along the pig-track
ahead was speedily followed by the appearance of
many small and grunting animals in rapid movement,
In fact, the entire track seemed to become filled with
them, and the sportsmen grew excited.
</p>

<p>
As the pigs dashed forward rifles snapped out their
missiles, and every shot went home.
</p>

<p>
Six fat porkers fell to the guns, and three more
were killed by revolver fire.  The beaters soon
appeared, and as their share of the day's sport three
pigs were handed over, while with the remaining
spoils slung over their weapons the men returned
home.  A great feast was enjoyed by all hands that
evening, and the Chinamen seemed perfectly contented
with the new life, and by no means anxious
to reach San Francisco.
</p>

<p>
However, during the next forenoon three frightened-looking
and extremely agitated women hastened into
camp, and by rapid signs informed the captain that
the vessel had returned to the island in search of more
male natives.
</p>

<p>
'Arm yourselves, all hands,' he promptly sang out.
'We shall endeavour to protect these poor people.  If
I can only put my hands on the scoundrels, they'll
not soon forget it.'
</p>

<p>
He then told the women that they need fear
nothing, and that as long as he remained on the spot
they should have his assistance.
</p>

<p>
The party soon reached the opposite side of the
island, and in a sheltered little bay found the vessel,
a schooner of fifty tons, at anchor.  None of her crew
had as yet landed.  The old man hastily laid a trap
for their arrest, and then awaited events.
</p>

<p>
It was not long before a boat full of cowardly
foreigners came on shore, and with revolvers concealed
in their clothing began to separate, in quest of some
new spot likely to prove successful for their purpose.
By the directions of Captain Thorne some of the
women now began to show themselves, and the
landing party immediately followed them.
</p>

<p>
The moment the ruffians had got well in-shore
the skipper and his men surrounded them.  A few
shots proved so effectual that within half an hour
the entire gang were made prisoners and disarmed.
The schooner was also taken, and, to the intense
astonishment and delight of the women, she was
found to be almost filled with their sons, husbands,
or brothers, captured only a few weeks previously.
</p>

<p>
All the unhappy men were promptly put on shore,
and the schooner made sail for Camp Bay, where the
'Alert' had been wrecked; and before sundown she
anchored there.  The prisoners were landed, and
thus another day of adventure on the island closed.
</p>

<p>
First thing next morning the carpenter set to work
fitting up a stout partition in the schooner's hold, so
that the Chinamen might be kept apart from the
'black-birders'; and on its completion the latter were
again placed on board.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, all hands had been busily collecting
stores for shipment, water from a good spring was
filled into every available cask, a fresh stock of pork
was killed, and, to mark their sense of gratitude, the
islanders presented an enormous stock of vegetables
and fruit.
</p>

<p>
At length the schooner set all her canvas, and
amidst the regrets of the natives left Camp Bay.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap17"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVII
<br /><br />
A FORTUNATE ESCAPE
</h3>

<p>
'After all, Sennit,' the old man exclaimed, as
the vessel cleared the island on her passage
to Honolulu, 'it has turned out most fortunate
that our boats were broken up by that gale.
We have been allowed to help those unfortunate
people.'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, sir,' the mate replied; 'and help to choke the
rascals down below, I hope.'
</p>

<p>
The little schooner proved to be a smart sailer, and
ripped along in such splendid style that without
further adventure she arrived at her destination, where
all the prisoners went to gaol to await trial.
</p>

<p>
Captain Thorne, however, presently discovered that
unless he was prepared to incur considerable expense
in taking his men to San Francisco by steam, there
was nothing left for him to do but to sail there in
the captured vessel.  He decided to take the latter
course.
</p>

<p>
The Chinamen at first made complaint of their
cramped quarters, but on finding that the entire hold
was now at their service they agreed to remain.
Whereupon more fresh stores and water were shipped,
and exactly ten days after entering Honolulu harbour
they again sailed for their original port of discharge.
</p>

<p>
With a rattling breeze and all sail set, out went
the vessel on her voyage toward San Francisco.
</p>

<p>
Of that trip nothing need be said.  A splendid
breeze carried them safely across the last portion of
the Pacific, and, as though fortune seemed determined
to make up for all previous trials and difficulties,
nothing worthy of the name of gale delayed their
progress.
</p>

<p>
On passing through the entrance of the
magnificent bay, under a full press of canvas, the
schooner raced along on inclined bilge, until at last
the anchor was dropped in two fathoms near the city,
and there awaited the appearance of the health
officer, to allow the surviving emigrants to land.
</p>

<p>
'Well, captain,' the doctor exclaimed, as he stepped
on board, 'you are a good while overdue.  Surely you
have not come all across the Pacific in a cockle-shell
like this?'
</p>

<p>
Captain Thorne laughed.  'Not exactly,' he said;
'yet small as she is she has brought us here much
more quickly than was expected.  I have not more
than forty of my emigrants shipped at Hong Kong
remaining.'
</p>

<p>
'By the way, captain, did not the "Alert" belong to
a certain Liverpool firm?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, sir, and I only joined her at Brisbane.'
</p>

<p>
'Well, then, I do not think you'll be long out of
employment.  In short, captain, one of your company's
ships is here now loading grain for the United
Kingdom, but, most unfortunately, her master met
with a fatal accident&mdash;fell into the hold&mdash;last week,
and died yesterday.  You should see the agent, and
secure the vacant position.'
</p>

<p>
'Is not her chief officer in charge?' the skipper
inquired.  'He will likely take her home.'
</p>

<p>
'He is not qualified to do so,' the doctor returned.
'Lose no time, captain.'
</p>

<p>
Leaving the schooner in charge of the mate, the
old man immediately acted on the advice; and on
explaining how the 'Alert' was lost, and his
connection with the firm owning the captainless ship, he
was directed to take charge of her, and get ready for
sea as quickly as possible.
</p>

<p>
'I must tell you, sir,' the agent added, 'that another
vessel is on the point of sailing for England.  She is
a well-known clipper, and as your predecessor
challenged her for a great race home, much excitement
has been aroused here, and everyone hopes that you
will do your utmost to win the prize of five thousand
dollars for the first arrival at Stonewell, where both
ships call for orders.'
</p>

<p>
'Well, sir,' the captain cheerily replied, 'since you
are intrusting me with such a pleasing and exciting
task, all I can say is, that every fathom of speed to
be got out of our vessel shall be strictly reeled-off.
Leave the matter with me.'
</p>

<p>
He immediately returned to the schooner, packed
what clothing had been saved from the wreck of the
'Alert,' and in charge of Jack Clewlin he also sent his
chronometers, charts, and other navigating gear on
board the new ship.
</p>

<p>
When Jack there learned that she was bound to
Stonewell for orders his joy knew no bounds.  But
parting from Readyman and all those with whom
he had been so long associated would prove a painful
matter, since, of course, he knew that he must follow
Captain Thorne.  But even those troubles were
speedily dispelled.
</p>

<p>
Nearly half the crew of the 'Ocean Glory,' as the
ship was named, had been induced to desert, for the
sake of high wages ashore; their places were, however,
immediately filled by his old comrades, while the
mate and Mr. Statten accepted passages home as
third and fourth officers.  Thus all the friends were
enabled to meet again on the new craft, which was
a splendid clipper of nineteen hundred tons, and in
every respect likely to prove both comfortable and
speedy.  She was as finely modelled and more loftily
sparred than the 'Silver Crown,' and Jack looked
knowingly at her three standing skysail and main
moonsail yards, above the royals.  With so strong
a crew ready to 'put her through' on the run home,
it soon became evident that she would more than
hold her own, and her supporters became correspondingly
jubilant of success.
</p>

<p>
To be quite fair, however, there was no doubt that
her rival would prove a formidable foe.  She was
also beautifully designed, was slightly larger and
longer than her opponent, with wedge-like bow, clean
run, and she also carried several sails above the royals.
Both ships were 'like spick and span pins,' as sailors
say, and each had all her canvas 'bent.'
</p>

<p>
'Well, she looks a clipper every inch, Sennit,'
the skipper observed.  'All the same, though, if
you and I cannot put our charge through several
days ahead, things must have changed since we
met.'
</p>

<p>
'That's so, sir,' the mate replied.  'Some believe
we have no chance, but that's all bluff.  The others,
however, know their ship, and we've to discover
everything for ourselves.'
</p>

<p>
'We'll smash her, Sennit'
</p>

<p>
For a couple of days both vessels were busily
employed in shipping the last of their stores; and
during that interval Jack received a long letter from
home, in which his father hoped he was well, but
said that some anxiety was aroused by the lengthened
voyage of the 'Alert.'  An explanatory letter was
immediately despatched.
</p>

<p>
The rival clipper, 'Flying Scud' sailed first, and
with canvas mounting from the rails to the moonsail
yard made a fine show.  The long black hull was
relieved by a strip of painted ports, and careening
gracefully she sped quickly out of the bay.
</p>

<p>
'Mark her time to the offing, Sennit!' the old man
exclaimed; 'that will give us a fair idea of her speed.
I take notice that they haven't sent a rope-yarn of
stu'n's'l gear aloft yet.  Perhaps she doesn't carry
any.  The younger skippers say it doesn't compensate
for the cost and trouble.'
</p>

<p>
'We'll show them that this voyage, sir,' the mate
said.  'I begin to think we have a good chance of
getting the prize.'
</p>

<p>
'Chance!  I'll smash her, Sennit.'
</p>

<p>
Owing to some mistake about the nationality of
the 'black-birding' schooner, the 'Ocean Glory' was
detained till nearly sundown, but when the chief
officer sang out to man the windlass all hands rushed
to the levers.  The cable came in with a rattle, and
across the beautiful bay went the chanty:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'The breeze is from the east-south-east,<br />
  And she can sail ten knots at least.<br />
  Our officers we will obey,<br />
  So now to grog, my lads, I say.<br />
  For we are homeward-bound, my boys,<br />
  We are homeward-bound.'<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
'Cable's hove short, sir,' Mr. Fortune, the mate,
sang out.
</p>

<p>
The youngsters at the main capstan 'pawled' it.
The hands, knowing what would follow, left the
forecastle-head.
</p>

<p>
'Loose all canvas fore and aft,' the skipper sang out.
</p>

<p>
'We'll race the after-guards for it!' a man cried in
defiance, as he sprang up the main rigging.
</p>

<p>
'And we'll take you,' Jack Clewlin returned, as,
smartly mustering all his younger associates of the
half-deck, he had them skipping from yard to yard
on the mizen mast, casting off the gaskets, and
overhauling the running gear.  Then, sliding down
to the quarter-deck he forced the steward, carpenter,
sailmaker, and boys to man the halyards.  Up went
the topsail and other yards with a leap, and before
those forward had realised the fact every stitch of
sail aft was set.
</p>

<p>
'Well done, Clewlin!' the skipper exclaimed.
'You've fairly beaten your opponents.'
</p>

<p>
As the anchor was broken out the 'Ocean Glory'
canted her head seaward, and under all sail, and with
bunting flowing bravely in the breeze, away toward
the offing she glided with ever-increasing movement.
A hearty cheer followed her from the shore.  Not
a moment was lost in getting more canvas spread.
The studding-sail booms were dragged off the skids
and sent aloft, that gear was promptly rove by
experienced and nimble hands, and before sundown
the clipper had reached well out beyond the
Golden Gates, and the time taken by the old man
proved that she had covered the distance much more
quickly than her rival.
</p>

<p>
With a light five-knot breeze steady progress was
made throughout the night, the anchors were secured
on the forecastle-head, watches were 'picked' by the
officers, and Jack Clewlin and his 'side' turned in
till midnight.
</p>

<p>
The ship proved to be somewhat heavily laden, but
of that no notice was taken, since long before Cape
Horn was reached, the daily consumption of food
and water would have made some difference in her
trim, while the cargo of grain would also have settled
down firmly in its place, and thus enable the captain
to observe any slight peculiarity of trim.
</p>

<p>
Nothing whatever could be seen of the 'Flying
Scud'; every day a bright lookout for her was
maintained by men engaged at work aloft, and still
the wind remained fair and moderately strong.
</p>

<p>
Ten days after leaving port the first vessel was
seen, and proved to be, not the 'Flying Scud,' as was
at first supposed, but a San Francisco-bound ship,
one hundred and twenty days out from the Mersey,
and she signalled need of a few fresh provisions.
Captain Thorne immediately drew closer, and having
sent what food could be spared to the stranger, he
inquired if she had seen anything of his rival.
</p>

<p>
'A big painted-port craft, eh?' the other master
inquired.  'Yes, we fell in with her three hours ago.
Yet, in spite of my crippled condition and want of
grub, she would not pay the slightest heed, but
continued her voyage.  She's nearly abreast of you
now, but several miles farther west.'
</p>

<p>
'Then we have beaten her already,' Captain Thorne
sang out.  'Thank you, sir, and a speedy arrival in
port.  I'm sorry I can afford no better assistance.'
</p>

<p>
'So long, captain.  I'll tell them at 'Frisco that
you're miles ahead.  By the way, that other craft is
not carrying stu'n's'ls.  It's the new fashion, I
believe.'
</p>

<p>
The 'Ocean Glory' continued her voyage, crossed
the equator in good style, and after a delay of only
one day she struck the first of the south-east trade
winds, and in one long close-hauled board stood
away about south-west-by-south, still keeping a sharp
watch for the slightest sign of her opponent, and
making rapid progress toward the bleak and stormy
latitudes of Cape Horn.
</p>

<p>
Early one morning, in latitude 57°, 48' south,
a hand aloft reported the 'Flying Scud' standing
as themselves, some fifteen miles to the westward,
and great excitement prevailed.
</p>

<p>
'I don't believe it can be that vessel!' the old man
exclaimed.  'Clewlin, you have sharp eyes; here,
take my glasses, and find out if she is really our rival.'
</p>

<p>
Within a few seconds Jack had perched himself
snugly on the royal yard.  He had some difficulty in
picking up the vessel, yet, once he got her fairly
focused she was not again lost sight of, but was
certainly steering much 'freer' than themselves.
</p>

<p>
'It isn't the clipper, sir,' Jack presently sang out.
'She is all black fore and aft, and only carries royals.'
</p>

<p>
'I thought so,' the old man said.  'She's either
a Sidney or a Melbourne packet, and is, of course,
going easier.'
</p>

<p>
The stranger knew nothing of the 'Flying Scud.'  As
she drew up nearly abreast Captain Thorne eased
his helm, and with yards slightly checked in the
'Ocean Glory' almost kept her place, despite the
fact that the other was flying light with wool and
passengers.
</p>

<p>
'Set our starboard topmast stu'n's'l,' the skipper
sang out.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Fortune, unaccustomed to such 'carrying on,'
eyed him nervously, but soon had the canvas set.
It added half a knot, and made up the even ten knots
an hour.  Neither vessel now gained any advantage,
and the old man smiled cheerfully.
</p>

<p>
Darkness soon hid both vessels.  During the night
the wind began to draw more aft, and although it was
blowing 'pretty fresh' Captain Thorne immediately
came on deck, and ordered the mate to set the lower
and port topmast stu'n's'ls.
</p>

<p>
'I won't be passed even by a wool ship, if I can
help it,' he added.
</p>

<p>
'I scarcely think she can stand them,' Mr. Fortune
observed.
</p>

<p>
'Then call Sennit, sir,' was the sharp reply.
</p>

<p>
His own old mate was promptly to the fore.  The
extra canvas was 'bent' and also set.  The strain on
all the gear was tremendous, and in rising anxiety the
watch alternately eyed it and the captain; but
everything stood splendidly, and the skysails and main
moonsail were stowed for the night.
</p>

<p>
Next morning the Australian was just visible
astern, and she had nothing above a main
top-gallant-sail set.  Anyhow, she soon began to 'wake
up' and set more canvas.
</p>

<p>
'What are we doing now, Fortune?' the skipper
inquired.
</p>

<p>
A couple of hands were called aft, and the log was
hove.  The captain himself took the sandglass and
awaited the order to 'Turn!'
</p>

<p>
The line flew out astern, the reel rattled and shook
as it had never done before, and the old man shouted,
'Stop!'
</p>

<p>
'Fourteen and a half knots, sir,' Mr. Fortune said.
'I've been in her two voyages, but never saw anything
like this.'
</p>

<p>
'But we've got to make up the even fifteen,'
Captain Thorne replied; 'set the royals and skysails.'
</p>

<p>
The mate went forward wagging his head, and the
watch began to talk; but the skipper got his fifteen
knots, and the wool ship disappeared.
</p>

<p>
All that day the vessel flew before the wind; but
toward evening the flying kites again came in.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVIII
<br /><br />
RACING HOMEWARD
</h3>

<p>
As the flying ship drew southward of the Cape
the weather became cold and stormy, while
the great seas followed her with tremendous
force, but they could never get any kind of serious
grip, and with resounding emphasis broke on either
quarter and rushed forward in seething foam.
</p>

<p>
So heavy did the wind become that, with much
regret, the captain was compelled to shorten sail, and
after the royals, studding-sails, and fore and mizen
topgallant-sails were stowed the long winter night
speedily closed down.
</p>

<p>
The barometer showed signs of further hard
weather to come, and at the eight o'clock change
of watches the main topgallant-sail, with the outer
jib and upper mizen topsail, came in.
</p>

<p>
By ten o'clock the following gale had increased
to a storm of considerable force, and after consultation
with the chief mate and Mr. Sennit the skipper decided
to put one reef in the main topsail, and two reefs in
the fore topsail; but before going aloft the men hauled
up the mainsail for stowage.  It was, of course, an
all hands job, and everyone knew that under such
circumstances not much repose would be possible for
several hours.
</p>

<p>
At that time there was a faint glimmer of
moonlight, sometimes obliterated when a heavy,
snow-laden cloud-bank passed overhead, but on other
occasions quite a strong light prevailed for several
minutes.
</p>

<p>
As the men reached the main topsail yard they
immediately lay out toward the yardarms, and down
on all a blinding snow-squall swooped.  Even men
close together could scarcely see each other, and
nothing whatever of the ship.  Nevertheless they
set about reefing the canvas; it was so wet and stiff
that, until the squall drove ahead, no hold could
be obtained.  The sail was like a great balloon in
front of the yard.
</p>

<p>
In the 'slings' Mr. Statten was shouting like a
bull, and up from the deck a faint 'Bear a hand!'
occasionally struggled.  In such a smother, and with
a sail board-stretched by wind, it was impossible
to act quickly.
</p>

<p>
At last the squall drove ahead.  The moon struggled
hard to cast a feeble gleam on the scene, and once
more the officer sang out for another trial of
strength.
</p>

<p>
One reef was 'tied up'; but while engaged on
another someone suddenly yelled&mdash;Jack Clewlin
thought that a hand had fallen from the yard&mdash;and
pointed at a mysterious-looking object
ahead.
</p>

<p>
Jack had never seen such a weird spectacle, and
for some time he could not imagine what it was.
A huge, faintly traceable, and greenish-coloured
mountain of mist, here and there cut into towering
pinnacles; it appeared right across the course of
the vessel.  He was not long left in doubt.
</p>

<p>
Men more intimately acquainted with those stormy
and dangerous seas knew at once the peril in which
the scudding ship was placed, and in stentorian tones
down to the deck went the cry, 'Ice right ahead!
Starboard, hard a-starboard!'
</p>

<p>
Instantly all hands dropped the work on which
they were engaged, and by backstay and rigging
slid down to man the braces.  At the same moment
every trace of moonlight vanished behind another
black and snow-laden cloud driving across its
face.
</p>

<p>
The wall of ice was no longer visible, and as the
vessel came to the wind a great sea burst in over
the weather quarter, almost filling the deck, but
doing no more harm than soaking all hands to the
skin, and lifting some of the fellows nearly over
the rail; hanging on to the ropes they were hauled
back in safety.
</p>

<p>
All that while the 'Ocean Glory' was forging
ahead, everyone momentarily expecting to feel her
crash on the ice, yet, most fortunately, such a
disaster did not occur.  More astonishing than all
was the sudden subsidence of the storm, for the
sea had become almost smooth.
</p>

<p>
Captain Thorne knew what that indicated, and
very cheerily he sang out on his crew.
</p>

<p>
'She's clear, and under the lee of the berg, men!'
he cried.
</p>

<p>
'Ay, ay, sir,' some of them returned; 'and it was
a close shave, no mistake.  But for that saving gleam
of moonlight, she had smashed her nose against it
long ago.'
</p>

<p>
There was to be no more racing that night.
</p>

<p>
When the hands had slipped into dry clothing
they were again sent aloft to stow the upper topsails,
and the ship lay-to till daylight, afraid to proceed
too hastily, in case other ice dangers might prove
more disastrous.  A double lookout was kept fore
and aft.
</p>

<p>
With the first show of daylight, and as the water
ahead seemed free of obstruction, out went all the
reefs, whole topsails were mastheaded, and in
magnificent style the beautiful clipper again raced
away on a true course.  Several immense bergs
some of them computed to be two or three miles
long, were seen far off on the starboard beam, but
during the remaining time spent in those low
latitudes no more ice was sighted.
</p>

<p>
When once assured of that, Captain Thorne
determined to make up for the few hours' detention
during that eventful night.  The whole main
top-gallant-sail was sheeted home and set, while even
to the surprise of Mr. Sennit, who had had long
experience of his superior, an order to 'rig out both
stu'n's'l booms' was passed.
</p>

<p>
Eyeing each other in amused astonishment the
men immediately sprang aloft to execute the
command.
</p>

<p>
'She'll scarcely bear it!' one exclaimed.  'I
believe she's doing fourteen knots now.'
</p>

<p>
'Ay, ay,' another fellow replied; 'but I heard
him tell the mate he meant to knock another one
out of her, and shouldn't mind losing a few booms
to win the race.'
</p>

<p>
She was running dead before the wind, and the
setting of those topmast studding-sails was a difficult
matter.  Nevertheless, they were soon pulling like
horses at their booms, and had not everything been
of the finest material nothing could have prevented
an accident.
</p>

<p>
'What do you think of this, Readyman?' Jack
smilingly inquired, as with great mounds of white
foam gleaming round her bows the 'Ocean Glory'
raced home in a truly surprising manner.  'We've
never done such sailing before.'
</p>

<p>
'And likely never will again,' the quarter-master
replied.  'I thought the "Silver Crown" could do
a decent bit of scooting, but this one would beat
her hollow.  Just look how she cuts into everything
like a knife, and she loaded to the scuppers.'
</p>

<p>
As the course was presently altered slightly to the
northward, more canvas was spread.  Day by day
runs of nearly four hundred miles became quite
common.  The weather grew much warmer and less
boisterous, the Falkland Islands were passed, and
without incident worthy of notice the equator was
again crossed for the second time that voyage; but
there the ship was unfortunately delayed by want
of wind.  However, the hands were kept busy in
getting her ready for port, the decks were holystoned
fore and aft, and after that paint and tar pots
became the order of the day.
</p>

<p>
Three days after crossing the line the Australian
clipper was sighted crawling northward, and being
so much lighter and higher in the water, she steadily
drew level, and signalled her surprise at finding her
rival so much ahead, but that of the 'Flying Scud'
nothing had been seen.
</p>

<p>
At last the first of the north-east trade wind began
to fill the canvas.  The ship drew away north, and
after a splendid passage of eighty-five days from
San Francisco she sighted the Irish coast in the
vicinity of Cape Clear.  An increasing south-westerly
breeze took her along in good style.
</p>

<p>
Jack Clewlin, full of delight at once again seeing
the outlines of his native land rising along the
horizon a-lee, could not be induced to leave his
lookout perch on the fore royal yard, and was the
first to hail the deck with a tremendous outburst
of joy, 'Stonewell lighthouse right ahead, sir!'
</p>

<p>
Half an hour later a pilot came alongside, and
for some seconds his ears tingled with the
oft-repeated inquiry, 'Has the "Flying Scud" arrived?'
</p>

<p>
'No,' the man replied.  'We've been watching
for her or you the last couple of days.  You have
won the prize.'
</p>

<p>
A hearty cheer greeted the announcement.
</p>

<p>
The 'Ocean Glory' dropped her anchor in the
outer roadstead of Stonewell Harbour, and after a
voyage of three years and ten months, Jack Clewlin,
now a tall, broad-shouldered young fellow of twenty,
completed his sea apprenticeship.
</p>

<p>
His father lost no time in reaching the ship,
gripped his son in a warm handshake, and heard
from Jack himself how much the lad appreciated
a life afloat.
</p>

<p>
Four days later the 'Flying Scud' arrived, and a
cheer greeted her disappointed crew.
</p>

<p>
To Readyman Captain Clewlin returned his
warmest thanks for the advice and assistance
afforded his son, and the good old quarter-master
felt considerable regret on parting from his young
shipmate.
</p>

<p>
The two ships received orders to proceed to
Liverpool, where Jack received his indentures, marked
with the words, 'The within has been fulfilled to our
entire satisfaction.'
</p>

<p>
With his father he soon returned home, and thus
ended the many remarkable incidents connected
with 'a boy's adventures round the world.'
